## Introduction

There are several possible ways of integration with CloudLinux OS:

* **Complete integration using new API** - exactly what is described in this document. This way a panel vendor will get all CloudLinux OS features (current and future) and maximum support. It’s recommended.
* **Manually Ad-hoc** - using low-level CLI utils. It is not recommended. It’s kind of “do it yourself way” - a control panel might use low-level utils like `lvectl` to set limits directly to a raw LVE by ID and control everything (including edge-cases) in its own code. There are many downsides of such approach e.g. only a small number of features can be implemented this way and any new changes in CloudLinux will require more and more updates to the control panel code, and can possibly even introduce bugs, etc. And although this way looks easier at first, it will become more and more difficult to maintain it over time.
* **Old API for CloudLinux OS limits** - described [here](/deprecated/#package-integration). It’s deprecated. It still works but will not get any updates.

## New API in a nutshell

The goal of the new API is to shift all complexity for controlling CloudLinux components from a control panel to the CloudLinux web UI and utils.
Most of the integration is done within a few steps:
1. A control panel vendor implements 7 simple scripts (any language) and specifies them in a special config file. All Cloudlinux OS components will look up and call them with some arguments to get all needed information from the control panel (e.g. users list, their hosting plans, domains, etc.)
2. Control panel should call hooks described below in a response to Admin/Users actions (e.g. changing end-user’s domain, creating new end-user, etc.). CloudLinux utils will do their stuff to reconfigure itself according to these events. There is no need to worry about what exactly they do because it will be related only to CloudLinux components and control panel will not be affected.
3. Configure the control panel and CageFS to work together by changing some configs.
4. Optionally embed CloudLinux web UI into the control panel. It is highly recommended because it does all you may need. You can use PHP scripts to embed SPA application to the specially prepared pages (with your menus) for LVE Manager and Selectors.


## General

* [Example of the integration config](/control_panel_integration/#example-of-the-integration-config)

To integrate CloudLinux into a control panel, you should implement the following interfaces required by the CloudLinux OS utilities:
* [CPAPI](/control_panel_integration/#control-panel-api-integration) — a small scripts/files-type interface to get the required information from the control panel
* [CP Hooks Integration](/control_panel_integration/#control-panel-hooks-integration) — a set of the CloudLinux OS scripts/commands. Control panel calls this set in response to its internal events
* [Web UI Integration(optional)](/control_panel_integration/#web-ui-integration) — various configuration parameters and scripts to embed interface SPA application into the control panel native interface. Optional, if CLI is enough
* [CageFS Integration](/control_panel_integration/#how-to-integrate-cagefs-with-a-control-panel) — some changes may be required in the config files to work and integrate with CageFS as well as additional support from a control panel
* [CloudLinux kernel set-up](/control_panel_integration/#cloudlinux-kernel-set-up)

Files related to integration (integration config file, CPAPI integration scripts and all their dependencies) as well as parent directories to place them (e.g. <span class="notranslate">`/opt/cpvendor/etc/`</span>) should be delivered/managed by the control panel vendor. They don't exist by default and should be created to activate integration mechanism. Most likely, they should be bundled with the control panel or installed with some CloudLinux support module (if CloudLinux support is not built-in).

Configuration related to integration should be placed in a valid INI file (further “integration config file”):

<div class="notranslate">

```
-rw-r--r-- root root /opt/cpvendor/etc/integration.ini
```
</div>

All users (and in CageFS too) should have read access to this file because some CPAPI methods have to work from end-user too. CloudLinux components only read this file and never write/create it.

The control panel vendor decides where to put CPAPI scripts (CloudLinux utils will read path to scripts from the integration file) but we recommend to put them into <span class="notranslate">`/opt/cpvendor/bin/`</span> (should be created by the vendor first) because <span class="notranslate">`/opt/*`</span> is mounted to CageFS by default and the standard location will save some time during possible support incidents.

We recommend to deliver a set of scripts for CPAPI and integration file as a separate RPM package. This can greatly simplify support for vendors as they will be able to release any updates and compatibility fixes separately from the panel updates and use dependencies/conflicts management provided by a package manager.

Assumed that this package contains a list of paths to the integration scripts (or to the one script if it deals with all `cpapi` commands). You can specify default script arguments in the <span class="notranslate">`integration_scripts`</span> section, additional arguments like <span class="notranslate">`filter`</span> and <span class="notranslate">`--name`</span> will be automatically added after the defined ones.

#### Example of the integration config

<div class="notranslate">

```
[integration_scripts]

panel_info = /opt/cpvendor/bin/panel_info
db_info = /opt/cpvendor/bin/db_info
packages = /opt/cpvendor/bin/packages
users = /opt/cpvendor/bin/users
domains = /opt/cpvendor/bin/vendor_integration_script domains
resellers = /opt/cpvendor/bin/vendor_integration_script resellers
admins = /opt/cpvendor/bin/vendor_integration_script admins



[lvemanager_config]
ui_user_info = /panel/path/ui_user_info.sh
base_path = /panel/path/lvemanager

run_service = 1
service_port = 9000

```
</div>

## Control panel API integration

To integrate CPAPI, set the paths to the scripts in the integration file in the <span class="notranslate">`integration_scripts`</span> section (see example above).

You can use different scripts for different CPAPI methods or only one script and call it with different arguments. The script is any executable file written in any programming language, that returns a valid JSON file of the specified format in response to arguments it is expected to be called.

### Integration scripts requirements

* [Legend](/control_panel_integration/#legend)

* By default, integration scripts should run only from UNIX user with the same credentials as LVE Manager is run, unless otherwise stated in the script description.
* Some scripts are run from both root and end-user. If the script is run from end-user it should return information related to this user only, filtering the irrelevant data for security/isolation purposes or return <span class="notranslate">`PermissionDenied`</span> if script is not intended to be run as this user at all.
* Scripts run from the end-user should also work from inside CageFS. You can find details on how to implement this [here](/control_panel_integration/#working-with-cpapi-cagefs)

#### Legend
* Necessity <span class="notranslate">`always`</span> means it’s required nearly by all CloudLinux code and should be implemented no matter what features you are interested in. Other methods might not be implemented and this will affect only some CloudLinux features leaving others to work fine.
* <span class="notranslate">`All UNIX users`</span> means any Linux system account (from <span class="notranslate">`/etc/passwd`</span>) that is able to execute CloudLinux utilities directly or indirectly.

### Working with CPAPI & CageFS

Some integration scripts required to be called not only from root but from end-user. Developing such scripts, you should keep in mind that CageFS is an optional component, so anything that works in CageFS must also work even if CageFS is disabled for a particular user or not installed at all.

This means that you should do one of the following:
* all required information (code, all its dependencies, all called binaries, all configs/files/caches it reads) should be available for a user (even in CageFS)
* you should use CageFS's [proxyexec](/cloudlinux_os_components/#executing-by-proxy) mechanism to make your script run itself in a real system but with user privileges
* use both configured sudo and proxyexec if your script needs privilege escalation (e.g. to read some credentials or other files that shouldn't be disclosed to end-user). SUDO mechanism is needed for cases when CageFS is not installed or disabled for a user and proxyexec is needed when a user executes script in CageFS

When using SUDO you should create the wrapper that will call your script using SUDO command, like this:

<div class="notranslate">

```
[root]# cat /opt/cpvendor/bin/domains
#!/usr/bin/env bash
sudo opt/cpvendor/bin/domains_real
```
</div>

Of course, you must configure <span class="notranslate">`/etc/sudoers`</span> to make it work without a password prompt and with enough security.

:::tip Note
Your script will run with <span class="notranslate">`root`</span> permissions, but limited with user's LVE. 
You may see the following warning:
```
***************************************************************************
*                                                                         *
*             !!!!  WARNING: YOU ARE INSIDE LVE !!!!                      *

***************************************************************************
```
This is the default behavior so users cannot overload a server with a lot of API requests.
:::

:::warning Warning
When using sudo, you must configure sudo with <span class="notranslate">NOSETENV</span> tag in order to forbid the user to override <span class="notranslate">`SUDO_USER`</span> environment or use other secure methods (e.g. <span class="notranslate">`logname`</span>) to get the user who ran the command through sudo.
:::

As an alternative for sudo you can use regular SUID scripts, but we strongly recommend using SUDO because of builtin logging of permissions escalation.

You can find more details on how to configure your scripts in CageFS properly here:

* [Configuration. General information](/cloudlinux_os_components/#configuration-2)
* [How to integrate CageFS with any control panel](/control_panel_integration/#how-to-integrate-cagefs-with-a-control-panel)

### Expected scripts responses

* [Internal errors](/control_panel_integration/#internal-errors)
* [Restricted access](/control_panel_integration/#restricted-access)
* [Error in arguments](/control_panel_integration/#error-in-arguments)
* [Nonexistent entities](/control_panel_integration/#nonexistent-entities)

Any integration script should return a valid UTF-8 encoded JSON.

There are two expected formats of integration script responses. In case of success, the <span class="notranslate">`metadata.result`</span> field is <span class="notranslate">`ok`</span> and the data field contains data according to the specification of the specific integration script. Return code is `0`.

<div class="notranslate">

```
{
  "data": object or array,
  "metadata": {
    "result": "ok"
  }
}
```
</div>

In case of error, the output should be one of the following: Internal errors, Restricted access, Error in arguments,  Nonexistent entities. 

#### Internal errors

When data is temporarily unavailable due to internal errors in the integration script (database unavailable, file access problems, etc), the output is as follows:

<div class="notranslate">

```
{
  "data": null,
  "metadata": {
    "result": "InternalAPIError",
    "message": "API is restarting, try again later"
  }
}
```
</div>

**Data description**

| | | |
|-|-|-|
|Key|Nullable|Description|
|message|False|Error message for an administrator printed by CloudLinux utility|

#### Restricted access

When data is unavailable due to restricted access of a user that called the script, the output is as follows: 

<div class="notranslate">

```
{
  "data": null,
  "metadata": {
    "result": "PermissionDenied",
    "message": "Only sudoers can view this section."
  }
}
```
</div>

**Data description**

| | | |
|-|-|-|
|Key|Nullable|Description|
|message|False|Error message for an administrator printed by CloudLinux utility|


:::tip Info
This kind of error should be used in the case when a user is requesting data that he does not have access to.
E.g., when a user named <span class="notranslate">`user1`</span> is running <span class="notranslate">`domains`</span> script with the argument <span class="notranslate">`--owner=user2`</span>, you must return this error.
:::

#### Error in arguments

When wrong arguments are passed to the utility, for example:
* unknown argument
* unknown fields in `--fields`

The output is as follows:

<div class="notranslate">

```
{
  "data": null,
  "metadata": {
    "result": "BadRequest",
    "message": "Unknown field ‘nosuchfield’"
  }
}
```
</div>

**Data description**

| | | |
|-|-|-|
|Key|Nullable|Description|
|message|False|Error message for an administrator printed by CloudLinux utility|


#### Nonexistent entities

When during data filtering the target entity doesn't exist in the control panel, the output is as follows:

<div class="notranslate">

```
{
  "data": null,
  "metadata": {
    "result": "NotFound",
    "message": "No such user `unix_user_name`"
  }
}
```
</div>

:::tip Info
This kind of error should be used only in the filtering case. In case when some script is called without filtering arguments and the control panel has no entities to return (e.g. domains) you should return an empty list/object.

### The list of the integration scripts

* [panel_info](/control_panel_integration/#panel-info)
* [db_info](/control_panel_integration/#db-info)
* [packages](/control_panel_integration/#packages)
* [users](/control_panel_integration/#users)

<div class="notranslate">

```
/scripts/panel_info
```
</div>

**Output example**

<div class="notranslate">

```
{
	"data": {
		"name": "SomeCoolWebPanel",

You can use the following placeholders in the template: <span class="notranslate">`{domain}`</span>. CloudLinux utility automatically replaces  placeholders to the real values. **Example**:<span class="notranslate">`“user_login_url_template”: “https://{domain}:2087/login”`</span> CloudLinux utility automatically replaces <span class="notranslate">`{domain}`</span>, and the link will look like <span class="notranslate">`https://domain.zone:2087/login`</span>|


#### <span class="notranslate">db_info</span>

Returns the information about databases that are available to the control panel users and are managed by the control panel.

:::warning WARNING!
For now, CloudLinux supports control panels only with MySQL databases.
:::

#### <span class="notranslate">domains</span>

Returns key-value object, where a key is a domain (or subdomain) and a value is a key-value object contains the owner name (UNIX users), the path to the site root specified in the HTTP server config, and the domain status (main or alternative).

::: warning WARNING
To make Python/Node.js/Ruby/PHP Selector workable, this script should be executed with user access and inside CageFS. When running this script as the user, you must limit answer scope to values, allowed for the user to view.
E.g. if the control panel has two domains: <span class="notranslate">`user1.com`</span> and <span class="notranslate">`user2.com`</span>, and <span class="notranslate">`user1`</span> Unix user owns only one of them, you should not return second one even if <span class="notranslate">`--name`</span> argument is not set explicitly.
:::

**Usage example**

<div class="notranslate">

```
/scripts/domains ([--owner=<unix_user>] | [--name=<name>])
```
</div>

**Arguments**

| | | |
|-|-|-|
|Key|Required|Description|
|<span class="notranslate">--owner, -o</span>|False|Used for filtering output; set a name of the owner whose domains to print|
|<span class="notranslate">--name, -n</span>|False|Used for filtering output; set a name of the domain, to display information about it|

**Output example**

## Control panel hooks integration

For proper CloudLinux operation, you should implement a hooks mechanism. Hooks are scripts that control panel invokes with the exact arguments at a specific time. The control panel is responsible for executing these scripts as a system root user.

### Managing administrators

::: tip Note
Some control panels allow to create several administrator accounts, each of which has a system user who is used to work with the LVE Manager plugin. In this case, all administrator accounts should be added to the sudoers and clsupergid. To do so, you can use our user-friendly interface.
:::

::: tip Note
If you don’t have several administrator accounts (or LVE Manager plugin always runs from the root) you don’t need to implement these hooks.
:::

After creating a new administrator, the control panel should call the following command:

<div class="notranslate">

```
/usr/share/cloudlinux/hooks/post_modify_admin.py create --username admin
```
</div>

| | | |
|-|-|-|
|Argument |Default |Description |
|<span class="notranslate">--name, -n</span>| - |The name of the newly created administrator account |

After removing the administrator, the following command should be called by the control panel:

<div class="notranslate">

```
/usr/share/cloudlinux/hooks/post_modify_admin.py delete --name admin
```
</div>

| | | |
|-|-|-|
|Argument |Default |Description |
|<span class="notranslate">--name, -n</span>| - |The name of removed UNIX user of administrator |

### Managing users

To manage user limits properly, CloudLinux utilities need information about the following control panel events.

After creating a new user, the following script should be called:

<div class="notranslate">

```
/usr/share/cloudlinux/hooks/post_modify_user.py create --username user --owner owner
```
</div>

| | | | |
|-|-|-|-|
|Argument |Mandatory |Default |Description |
|<span class="notranslate">--username, -u</span>|Yes | - |The name of administrator account to be removed |
|<span class="notranslate">--owner, -o</span>|Yes | - |A name of the account owner. The owner can be an administrator or a reseller |

After renaming a user (when a user name or a home directory was changed), the following script should be called:

<div class="notranslate">

```
/usr/share/cloudlinux/hooks/post_modify_user.py modify -u user --new-username newuser
```
</div>

| | | | |
|-|-|-|-|
|Argument |Mandatory |Default |Description |
|<span class="notranslate">-u ,--username</span>|Yes | - |The user name to be changed |
|<span class="notranslate">--new-username</span>|Yes | - |A new user name |

After moving the user to the new owner, the following command should be run:

<div class="notranslate">

```
/usr/share/cloudlinux/hooks/post_modify_user.py modify -u user --new-owner new_owner
```
</div>

| | | |
|-|-|-|
|Argument |Default |Description |
|<span class="notranslate">--new-owner</span>| - |The name of the new account owner. The owner can be an administrator or a reseller. |
|<span class="notranslate">--username, -u</span>| - |The account name (should be the same as the name in /etc/passwd). |

Before removing a user, the following command should be run:

<div class="notranslate">

```
/usr/share/cloudlinux/hooks/pre_modify_user.py delete --username user
```
</div>

| | | |
|-|-|-|
|Argument |Default |Description |
|<span class="notranslate">--username, -u</span>| - |The name of the account to be removed (should be the same as the name in /etc/passwd). |

After removing the user, you should call the following command:

<div class="notranslate">

```
/usr/share/cloudlinux/hooks/post_modify_user.py delete --username user
```
</div>

| | | |
|-|-|-|
|Argument |Default |Description |
|<span class="notranslate">--username, -u</span>| - |The name of the removed account |

### Managing domains

We expect that all domain-related data is stored inside the user's home directory. If your control panel stores domain-related data outside the user's home directory and that data can potentially change, please contact us so we can add support for this to our integration mechanism.

After renaming a domain (or any equivalent domain removal operation with transfer of all data to another domain), the following command should be run:

<div class="notranslate">

```
/usr/share/cloudlinux/hooks/post_modify_domain.py modify -u user --domain old_domain --new-domain new_domain [--include-subdomains]
```
</div>

| | | | |
|-|-|-|-|
|Argument |Mandatory |Default |Description |
|<span class="notranslate">--username, -u</span>|Yes | - |The name of the new domain owner (should be the same as the name in /etc/passwd). |
|<span class="notranslate">--domain</span>|Yes | - |The domain name to be changed |
|<span class="notranslate">--new-domain</span>|Yes | - |A new domain name |
|<span class="notranslate">--include-subdomains</span>|No |False |If set, all subdomains are renamed as well, i.e. when renaming domain.com → domain.eu the corresponding subdomain will be renamed as well test.domain.com → test.domain.eu.|

## Web UI integration

### ui-user-info script

* [Known issues for GUI unification](/control_panel_integration/#known-issues-for-gui-unification)

This script should return information about the current user opening Web UI. It is only used in UI part of the LVE Manager and utilities.

* Input value (first positional argument) — the current authentication token, passed on plugin open (for example, <span class="notranslate">`open.php?token=hash`</span>)
* Expected data format

<div class="notranslate">

```
{
    "userName": "user1",
    "userId": 1000,
    "userType": "user",
    "baseUri": "/user2/lvemanager/",
    "assetsUri": "/userdata/assets/lvemanager",
    "lang": "en",
    "userDomain": "current-user-domain.com"
}
```
</div>

* **<span class="notranslate">userName</span>** is used in queries to Selectors.
* **<span class="notranslate">userId</span>** - system user ID if exist.
* **<span class="notranslate">userType</span>** - can have the following values: “user”, “reseller”, “admin”
* **<span class="notranslate">lang</span>** - used to identify a current locale in the user interface (‘en’, ‘ru’ - two-character language code)
* **<span class="notranslate">userDomain</span>** - a current user domain. It can be the default domain or any selected user domain. Used to display in Selector. For example, in DirectAdmin the control panel opens only if a domain is selected — the selected domain is set. In cPanel, a domain is not selected — the default domain is set. If a domain is absent —  leave empty.
* **<span class="notranslate">baseUri</span>** - URI where LVE Manager files are available on the webserver
* **<span class="notranslate">assetsUri</span>** - URI where assets files for LVE Manager are available on the webserver

The following configuration file parameters are used to determine the location of the plugin UI part.

* **<span class="notranslate">base_path</span>** - the path to copy file assets to make them available from the control panel. Optional if <span class="notranslate">`/usr/share/l.v.e-manager/commons`</span> and <span class="notranslate">`/usr/share/l.v.e-manager/panelless-version/lvemanager`</span> are available from the control panel and the paths to this directory in web server are set.
Files are copied or replaced by <span class="notranslate">`yum update lvemanager`</span> command.
* **<span class="notranslate">run_service</span>** - enable LVE Manager web server. If it is set to 1 when installing or updating LVE Manager, we enable and run the web server with LVE Manager
* **<span class="notranslate">service_port</span>** - a port used for running a web server for access LVE Manager without the control panel
  
#### Known issues for GUI unification

:::warning Known issues for GUI unification

A user can run standalone services to provide access to LVE Manager without UI integration. These services use system authentication for users and the integration script <span class="notranslate">`ui-user-info script`</span> to get information about the current user.

These services have some issues:

* The ability to download log files from <span class="notranslate">CloudLinux Wizard</span> is missed
* Incorrect layout for some UI forms (Node.js Selector/Python Selector)
* Dashboard does not open CageFS options
* Some errors are not displayed

These issues will be fixed in the near future.
:::

## PHP-based integration of WEB UI with the control panel

The first use case:

<div class="notranslate">

```
require_once('lvemanager/widget.php');
```
</div>

This script defines the type of user and displays icons to open plugins included in LVE Manager.
You can customize your styles by copying the file content and setting your control panel styles.
In this case, all LVE Manager plugins will be opened in a new window.

The second use case:

Embedding the specific plugin into the control panel page.

<div class="notranslate">

```
<?php
require_once('lvemanager/LveManager.php');
$manager = new LveManager(‘<pluginName>’);
$manager->setCSRFToken();
?>
<html><body>
<?php
echo $manager->insertPanel();
?>
</body></html>
```
</div>

Pass the plugin name to the class constructor to initialize the plugin (user name will be defined).
At the time of the insertPanel method invocation, the SPA application with the specified Selector will be embedded.

Queries to the backend are created separately in the points (PHP files) which are located in the LVE Manager catalog.

### UI with CageFS enabled

LVE Manager scripts run outside of CageFS (on production systems). When calling API, LVE Manager scripts enter CageFS if needed (Node.js Selector, Python Selector). PHP Selector API does not work if the script is started inside CageFS and returns an error.

As for Node.js Selector and Python Selector, they are supposed to be contained inside CageFS because end-users can start scripts from UI (npm run, pip install). That is the reason why they should run inside LVE.

PHP Selector run outside of CageFS. When PHP Selector is called, it is not limited by LVE which allows an end-user whose web site is reaching its limits to use PHP Selector UI without problems.

## How to integrate CageFS with a control panel

CageFS documentation can be found here: [CageFS](/cloudlinux_os_components/#cagefs)

### CageFS MIN_UID  

CageFS has MIN_UID setting. Users with UIDs < MIN_UID will not be limited by CageFS. This setting is configured based on UID_MIN setting from <span class="notranslate">`/etc/login.defs`</span> file by default. So, typically MIN_UID is 500 on CloudLinux 6 and 1000 on CloudLinux 7.

You can obtain current MIN_UID value by executing the following command:

<div class="notranslate">

```
cagefsctl --get-min-uid
```
</div>

You can set MIN_UID by executing the following command:

<div class="notranslate">

```
cagefsctl --set-min-uid <value>
```
</div>

For example, to set MIN_UID to 10000, you should execute the following command:

<div class="notranslate">

```
cagefsctl --set-min-uid 10000
```
</div>

### PAM configuration for CageFS

CageFS is enabled for su, ssh and cron services by default.
[PAM Configuration](/cloudlinux_os_components/#pam-configuration)

Also you can enable CageFS for any service that uses PAM.
[LVE PAM Module](/cloudlinux_os_components/#lve-pam-module)

:::tip
It is safe to enable an interactive shell (e.g. /bin/bash) for users when CageFS is enabled.
:::

### Integrating CageFS with Apache

You should apply CloudLinux patches to integrate CageFS with Apache. Details can be found here:
[Integration of Apache modules in Control Panels](/control_panel_integration/#integration-of-apache-modules-in-control-panels)

Note that it may be required to execute <span class="notranslate">`cagefsctl --force-update`</span> after Apache rebuild in order to update CageFS.

### Running commands inside CageFS

You may want to execute commands inside CageFS for security reasons. To do so, you can execute a command inside CageFS in the following way:

<div class="notranslate">

```
/bin/su -s /bin/bash -c “$COMMAND” - $USER
/sbin/cagefs_enter_user $USER "$COMMAND"
```
</div>

The commands above require root privileges. You can use the following command when running as a user:

<div class="notranslate">

```
/bin/cagefs_enter "$COMMAND"
```
</div>

### Updating CageFS skeleton

Updating CageFS skeleton is required after update of the system RPM packages. It may be also required after update of hosting control panel itself.

To update CageFS skeleton, execute the following command:

<div class="notranslate">

```
cagefsctl --force-update
```
</div>

CageFS RPM package installs a daily cron job that updates CageFS skeleton

<div class="notranslate">

```
/etc/cron.d/cp-cagefs-cron
```
</div>

You can set update period for CageFS skeleton in days using

<div class="notranslate">

```
cagefsctl --set-update-period <days>
```
</div>

### Setting up directories for PHP sessions

Each user in CageFS has its own <span class="notranslate">`/tmp`</span> directory that is not visible for other users. PHP scripts save sessions in <span class="notranslate">`/tmp`</span> directory by default (when <span class="notranslate">`session.save_path`</span> directive is empty). However, you can set up a different location for PHP sessions specific to each PHP versions using CageFS per-user [mounts](/cloudlinux_os_components/#mount-points) like it is done for alt-php. Simply add a line like below to <span class="notranslate">`/etc/cagefs/cagefs.mp`</span>

<div class="notranslate">

```
@/opt/alt/php54/var/lib/php/session,700
```
</div>

and then execute

<div class="notranslate">

```
cagefsctl --remount-all
```
</div>

to apply changes. After that, session files will be stored in <span class="notranslate">`/opt/alt/php54/var/lib/php/session`</span> inside user’s CageFS. In real file systems these files can be found inside `.cagefs` directory in user’s home directory. For above example, given that user’s home directory is <span class="notranslate">`/home/user`</span>, the files will reside in <span class="notranslate">`/home/user/.cagefs/opt/alt/php54/var/lib/php/session`</span> directory. TMP directory for the user will be located in <span class="notranslate">`/home/user/.cagefs/tmp`</span>. 
Temporary files including php sessions in `/tmp` directories in CageFS are cleaned using `tmpwatch`. You can change the period of removing old temporary files or set up additional directories for cleaning according to the documentation: 
[TMP directories](/cloudlinux_os_components/#tmp-directories).

Knowing the location where PHP sessions are stored (described above), you can also implement any custom script for cleaning PHP sessions. Remember to drop permissions (switch to the appropriate user) when removing the files (for example using sudo).

### Creating new user account

When user or admin account has been created, you should execute an appropriate hook script.
More about CloudLinux hooks subsystem: [Control Panel Hooks Integration](/control_panel_integration/#control-panel-hooks-integration)

:::tip Note
It is safe to enable an interactive shell (/bin/bash) for users when CageFS is enabled.
:::

:::warning IMPORTANT
Execute the post hook described in the link above after the account has been created completely. When the account is being transferred to another server or restored from backup, all files in user’s home directory should be written/restored completely BEFORE executing the post hooks, including files in <span class="notranslate">`~/.cl.selector`</span> directory. This is required to setup/restore PHP Selector settings for the user correctly. If PHP Selector settings were not restored correctly, you can recreate them by executing

<div class="notranslate">

```
rm -rf /var/cagefs/`/usr/sbin/cagefsctl --getprefix $username`/$username/etc/cl.selector
rm -rf /var/cagefs/`/usr/sbin/cagefsctl --getprefix $username`/$username/etc/cl.php.d
/usr/sbin/cagefsctl --force-update-etc "$username"
```
</div>
:::

:::warning IMPORTANT
You should create <span class="notranslate">`/etc/cagefs/enable.duplicate.uids`</span> empty file when your control panel creates users with duplicate UIDs. It is required for CageFS to operate properly.
:::

### Modifying user accounts

You should execute appropriate hook script when an account has been modified: [Control Panel Hooks Integration](/control_panel_integration/#control-panel-hooks-integration)

### Removing user accounts

CageFS has <span class="notranslate">`userdel`</span> hook script <span class="notranslate">`/usr/bin/userdel.cagefs`</span>, that is configured in <span class="notranslate">`/etc/login.defs`</span> file:

<div class="notranslate">

```
USERDEL_CMD /usr/bin/userdel.cagefs
```
</div>

This script performs all necessary actions when a user is being removed.
Anyway, you should execute appropriate hook script when removing an account:
[Control Panel Hooks Integration](/control_panel_integration/#control-panel-hooks-integration)

### Excluding users from CageFS

If you need to exclude some system users from CageFS that are specific to your control panel, you can do this by creating a file (any name would work) inside <span class="notranslate">`/etc/cagefs/exclude`</span> folder, and list users that you would like to exclude from CageFS in that file (each user in separate line). Then execute

<div class="notranslate">

```
cagefsctl --user-status USER
```
</div>

to apply changes and check that the command shows <span class="notranslate">_Disabled_</span>:
[Excluding users](/cloudlinux_os_components/#excluding-users)

### How to add a file or a directory to CageFS

* [Copy files and directories to CageFS](/control_panel_integration/#copy-files-and-directories-to-cagefs)
* [Mount an entire directory with needed files to CageFS](/control_panel_integration/#mount-an-entire-directory-with-needed-files-to-cagefs)

There are two major ways to add files and directories to CageFS:

1. copy files and directories to CageFS
2. mount an entire directory with needed files to CageFS


#### Copy files and directories to CageFS

:::warning Note
Please do not modify any existing files in the <span class="notranslate">`/etc/cagefs/conf.d`</span> directory because they may be overwritten while updating CageFS package. You should create a new file with a unique name instead.
:::

In order to copy files and directories to CageFS, you can manually create a custom config file in <span class="notranslate">`/etc/cagefs/conf.d`</span> directory.

Also, you can add files and directories that belong to `rpm` package to CageFS as follows:

* execute <span class="notranslate">`cagefsctl --addrpm PACKAGE`</span> command
* execute <span class="notranslate">`cagefsctl --force-update`</span> command to apply changes, i.e. to copy files and directories to the <span class="notranslate">`/usr/share/cagefs-skeleton`</span> directory.

There is a daily cron job that copies new and removes unneeded files and directories, i.e. updates cagefs-skeleton.

You should execute <span class="notranslate">`cagefsctl --force-update`</span> after each change of system configuration or after installing new software. Otherwise, CageFS will only be updated every 24 hours by a daily cron job.

The benefits of this approach:
* users in CageFS cannot modify files in the real file system (for example, in case of wrong permissions), because files in cagefs-skeleton are the copies of files from the real file system (and not mounted to CageFS)
* you can copy specific _safe_ files from some directory from the real file system to CageFS, and not copy all files and not mount the entire directory.

You can find more info [here](/cloudlinux_os_components/#file-system-templates).

#### Mount an entire directory with needed files to CageFS

The second way to add files and directories to CageFS is to mount the entire directory containing the files to CageFS.

This approach should be used for frequently updated files (like UNIX sockets) or for directories with a large number of files or with files that occupy much disk space.

The benefits of this approach:
* no delay between update of the file in the real file system and update of the file in CageFS; when file or directory is changed in the real file system they will be changed in CageFS immediately
* data is mounted but not copied to CageFS, so this minimizes IO load while updating cagefs-skeleton

Please make sure that the mounted directory does not contain sensitive data.

You can mount a directory from the real system to CageFS via <span class="notranslate">`/etc/cagefs/cagefs.mp`</span> config file.

To apply changes of mount points in <span class="notranslate">`/etc/cagefs/cagefs.mp`</span> file you should execute the following command:

<div class="notranslate">

```
cagefsctl --remount-all
```
</div>

You can find more info [here](/cloudlinux_os_components/#mount-points).

### Users' home directory

CageFS mounts users' home directories to CageFS automatically. Usually, there is no need to configure anything. However, if your control panel uses a custom path to users' home directories (for example <span class="notranslate">`/home/$USER/data`</span> instead of <span class="notranslate">`/home/$USER`</span>), then it may be necessary to configure Base Home Directory setting:
[Base Home Directory](/cloudlinux_os_components/#base-home-directory)

The modes of mounting users' home directories into CageFS are described here: 
[Mounting user’s home directory inside CageFS](/cloudlinux_os_components/#mounting-users-home-directory-inside-cagefs)

### Excluding files from CageFS

CageFS has a default set of files and directories that are visible to users inside CageFS. If you wish to exclude some of these files or directories from CageFS, you can do this as described below:
[Excluding files](/cloudlinux_os_components/#excluding-files) 

### Executing commands outside CageFS via proxyexec

SUID programs cannot run inside CageFS due to “nosuid” mounts. But you can give users in CageFS the ability to execute some specific commands outside CageFS via `proxyexec`.

Typically, these commands are suid programs or other programs that cannot run inside CageFS (due to complex dependencies, for example). Examples of such programs are <span class="notranslate">`passwd`</span>, <span class="notranslate">`exim`</span> or <span class="notranslate">`sendmail`</span> commands.

* Regular (not suid) commands will be executed as user inside the user’s LVE, but outside of CageFS.
* SUID commands will be executed in the user’s LVE outside of CageFS with the effective UID set to the owner of the file being executed.

You can find more details [here](/cloudlinux_os_components/#executing-by-proxy).

:::tip Note
You should use this feature with caution because it gives users the ability to execute specified commands outside of CageFS. SUID commands are extremely dangerous because they are executed not as a user, but as an owner of the file (typically root). You should give users the ability to execute safe commands only. These commands should not have known vulnerabilities.
You should check that users cannot use these commands to get sensitive information on a server. You can disable specific _dangerous_ options of programs executed via proxyexec (see below).
:::


### Filtering options for commands executed by proxyexec

It is possible to disable specific *dangerous* options of programs executed via `proxyexec`. More details:
[Filtering options for commands executed by proxyexec](/cloudlinux_os_components/#filtering-options-for-commands-executed-by-proxyexec).

## Integrating CloudLinux PHP Selector

Complete documentation for CloudLinux PHP Selector can be found here:
[PHP Selector](/cloudlinux_os_components/#php-selector)

:::tip Note
CloudLinux PHP Selector requires CageFS, so integration of CageFS must be completed before starting PHP Selector integration.
:::

If your control panel has some PHP version selector installed already, we suggest you not to enable CloudLinux PHP Selector for your users, so they will not be confused by two multiple PHP Selectors. However, if you want to use CloudLinux PHP Selector anyway, you can refer to the following article to configure loading of extensions for alt-php: [PHP extensions](/cloudlinux_os_components/#php-extensions)

For proper operation of CloudLinux PHP Selector, you should specify location of native PHP binaries of your control panel in <span class="notranslate">`/etc/cl.selector/native.conf`</span>. Then execute

<div class="notranslate">

```
cagefsctl --setup-cl-selector
```
</div>

to apply changes.
More details: [Native PHP Configuration](/cloudlinux_os_components/#native-php-configuration)

You can configure CloudLinux PHP Selector to allow your customers to select any custom PHP version specific to your control panel. Here's how to do this:
[Roll your own PHP](/cloudlinux_os_components/#roll-your-own-php)

Also, you can compile and add your own PHP extensions to CloudLinux PHP Selector:
[Compiling your own extensions](/cloudlinux_os_components/#compiling-your-own-extensions) 

## Integration of Apache modules in control panels

We provide control panels with the ability to build their own Apache packages with modules such as alt-mod-passenger, mod_lsapi, mod_hostinglimits. This is due to the fact that control panels often have their own customly-built Apache. At the same time, the modules must be compiled with the version of Apache and APR libraries that control panels use. Therefore, if your control panel uses Apache that is provided by CloudLinux OS, you can use native packages with modules. The following table represents the RPM package compatibility.


RPMs of Apache provided by CloudLinux, if you are using:

| | |
|-|-|
|httpd |httpd24-httpd |
|then install:<br>`mod_lsapi`<br>`mod_hostinglimits`<br>`alt-mod-passenger` |then install:<br>`httpd24-mod_lsapi`<br>`httpd24-mod_hostinglimits`<br>`httpd24-alt-mod-passenger`|


If you use custom Apache, follow this documentation on how to build a package for your Apache.

### alt-mod-passenger


1. Download alt-mod-passenger sources

<div class="notranslate">

```
yumdownloader --source alt-mod-passenger --enablerepo=*source
```
</div>

2. Rebuild the package with your Apache using rpmbuild

<div class="notranslate">

```
rpmbuild --rebuild alt-mod-passenger-ver.cloudlinux.src.rpm
```
</div>

3. Remove dependencies from `httpd`, `apr`, `apr-util` packages (`-devel` packages as well) and set your Apache packages instead, in the alt-mod-passenger spec file. Also, set the path for the directory where your Apache configs are located with <span class="notranslate">`__apache_conf_dir`</span> in the spec file.

4. Rebuild the package again, this time you should get to the compilation stage. During compilation, you may encounter such errors:

<div class="notranslate">

```
* Checking for Apache 2 development headers...
     Found: no
* Checking for Apache Portable Runtime (APR) development headers...
     Found: no
* Checking for Apache Portable Runtime Utility (APU) development headers...
     Found: no
```
</div>

In this case, you should specify the paths of your custom Apache in <span class="notranslate">`alt-mod-passenger-5.3.7/utils/passenger`</span> file. You need to add paths to binaries such as `httpd`, `apu-1-config`, and `apxs`. For example the following lines should be added before the <span class="notranslate">`passenger-install-apache2-module`</span> call:

<div class="notranslate">

```
export APU_CONFIG="${PATH_IN_YOUR_SYSTEM}/bin/apu-1-config"
export HTTPD="${PATH_IN_YOUR_SYSTEM}/sbin/httpd"
export APXS2="${PATH_IN_YOUR_SYSTEM}/bin/apxs"
```
</div>

5. Rebuild the package again, if everything is set correctly, there shouldn't be any problems.

6. Install the module, check that it is successfully loaded into Apache.

### mod_hostinglimits

1. Download mod_hostinglimits sources

<div class="notranslate">

```
yumdownloader --source mod_hostinglimits --enablerepo=*source
```
</div>

2. Rebuild the package with your Apache using rpmbuild

<div class="notranslate">

```
rpmbuild --rebuild mod_hostinglimits-ver.el7.cloudlinux.1.src.rpm
```
</div>

3. Remove dependencies such as `httpd`, (`-devel` packages as well) and set your Apache packages instead, in the mod_hostinglimits spec file. Also, check the paths that lead to the <span class="notranslate">`modules`</span> or <span class="notranslate">`conf.d`</span> directories and change them if they are different on your system.

4. Rebuild the package again, this time you should get to the compilation stage. During compilation, you may encounter the following errors:

<div class="notranslate">

```
-- Not Found Apache Bin Directory: APACHE2_2_HTTPD_BIN-NOTFOUND, APACHE2_2_HTTPD_MODULES-NOTFOUND
-- Can't find Apache2.2: APACHE2_2_HTTPD_INCLUDE_DIR-NOTFOUND
```
</div>

In this case, you should specify the paths of your custom Apache in <span class="notranslate">`mod_hostinglimits-1.0/cmake/FindApacheForBuild.cmake`</span> file. According to macros above, add the paths to the directory where httpd bin is located, to the dir where apache modules are located and to the dir where include files are located. It may look the following way:

<div class="notranslate">

```
FIND_PATH (APACHE2_2_HTTPD_INCLUDE_DIR 
   NAMES 
      httpd.h
   PATHS
      ${APACHE2_2_INCLUDES_DIR}
      /usr/local/include/httpd
      /usr/include/httpd
      /usr/include/apache
      /usr/local/apache/include/       # added line
)
```
</div>

5. Rebuild the package again, if you set everything correctly, there shouldn't be any problems.

6. Install the module, check that it is successfully loaded into Apache.

### mod_lsapi

1. Install the packages needed to build mod_lsapi from the source

<div class="notranslate">

```
yum install -y rpm-build
yum install -y liblsapi liblsapi-devel
yum install -y autoconf cmake apr-devel apr-util-devel
yum install -y python-lxml pytest python-mock
```
</div>

On CloudLinux 7 you also should install criu related packages

<div class="notranslate">

```
yum install -y criu-lve python-criu-lve criu-lve-devel crit-lve
```
</div>

2. Download mod_lsapi sources

<div class="notranslate">

```
yumdownloader --source mod_lsapi --enablerepo=*source
```
</div>

3. Rebuild the package with your Apache using rpmbuild

<div class="notranslate">

```
rpmbuild --rebuild mod_lsapi-ver.el7.cloudlinux.src.rpm
```
</div>

4. Remove building dependency from `httpd-devel` in the <span class="notranslate">`mod_lsapi.spec`</span> spec file located in the <span class="notranslate">`~/rpmbuild/SPECS/`</span> directory.

5. Change the paths to copy `mod_lsapi.so` and `mod_lsapi.conf` in the %install section of the `mod_lsapi.spec` file. For example, if Apache root is `/usr/local/apache`, then modules directory and config files directory will be <span class="notranslate">`/usr/local/apache/modules`</span> and <span class="notranslate">`/usr/local/apache/conf.d`</span> respectively. So for the config file you should substitute the following line in the <span class="notranslate">`%install`</span> section:

<div class="notranslate">

```
install -D -m 644 conf/mod_lsapi.conf $RPM_BUILD_ROOT%{g_path}/confs/lsapi.conf
```
</div>

with the following line:

<div class="notranslate">

```
install -D -m 644 conf/mod_lsapi.conf $RPM_BUILD_ROOT/usr/local/apache/conf/lsapi.conf
```
</div>

And, also, for the module you should substitute the following line in the <span class="notranslate">`%install`</span> section:

<div class="notranslate">

```
install -D -m 755 build/lib/mod_lsapi.so $RPM_BUILD_ROOT%{g_path}standard/mod_lsapi.so 
```
</div>

with the following line:

<div class="notranslate">

```
install -D -m 755 build/lib/mod_lsapi.so $RPM_BUILD_ROOT/usr/local/apache/modules/mod_lsapi.so
```
</div>

Also you should add mentions of both module and config files in the <span class="notranslate">`%files`</span> section of <span class="notranslate">`mod_lsapi.spec`</span>. For example, for <span class="notranslate">`/usr/local/apache`</span> Apache root the following two lines should be added:

<div class="notranslate">

```
%config /usr/local/apache/conf.d/lsapi.conf
/usr/local/apache/modules/mod_lsapi.conf
```
</div>

6. Rebuild the package again, this time you should get to the compilation stage. During compilation, you may encounter some errors:

<div class="notranslate">

```
-- Not Found Apache Bin Directory: APACHE2_2_HTTPD_BIN-NOTFOUND, APACHE2_2_HTTPD_MODULES-NOTFOUND
-- Can't find Apache2.2: APACHE2_2_HTTPD_INCLUDE_DIR-NOTFOUND
```
</div>

In this case, you should specify the paths of your custom Apache in the <span class="notranslate">`mod_lsapi-1.1/cmake/FindApacheForBuild.cmake`</span> file. According to macros above, add the paths to the directory where httpd binary is located, to the dir where apache modules are located and to the dir where include files are located. It may look a such way:

<div class="notranslate">

```
FIND_PATH (APACHE2_2_HTTPD_INCLUDE_DIR 
   NAMES 
      httpd.h
   PATHS
      ${APACHE2_2_INCLUDES_DIR}
      /usr/local/include/httpd
      /usr/include/httpd
      /usr/include/apache
      /usr/local/apache/include/       # added line
)
```
</div>

7. Rebuild the package again, if you set everything correctly, there shouldn't be any problems.

8. Install the module, check that it is successfully loaded into Apache.


## MySQL Governor

1. Install MySQL Governor

<div class="notranslate">

```
yum install governor-mysql
```
</div>

2. MySQL Governor supports only `cl-MariaDB**` or `cl-MySQL**` packages. Follow the [documentation](/cloudlinux_os_components/#mysql-governor) to figure out all supported versions.

<div class="notranslate">

```
/usr/share/lve/dbgovernor/mysqlgovernor.py --mysql-version=mysqlXX
```
</div>

3. Backup your databases.

4. Run the cl-MySQL/cl-MariaDB installation.

<div class="notranslate">

```
/usr/share/lve/dbgovernor/mysqlgovernor.py --install
```
</div>

5. After installation, check that the database server is working properly. If you have any problems, contact [support](http://helpdesk.cloudlinux.com/)

6. Configure user mapping to the database. The mapping format is described in the following [section](/cloudlinux_os_components/#mapping-a-user-to-a-database). The control panel should automatically generate such mapping and write it to <span class="notranslate">`/etc/container/dbuser-map`</span>. Usually, it is enough to write a hook when adding, deleting or renaming a database for a user. The control panel should implement such a mechanism for MySQL Governor to operate properly. MySQL Governor automatically applies changes from the dbuser-map file every five minutes.

7. MySQL Governor configuration can be found in the following [section](/cloudlinux_os_components/#configuration-3).

8. MySQL Governor CLI tools description can be found in the following [section](/command-line_tools/#mysql-governor)

9. Having configured the mapping use `dbtop` to see the current user load on the database (you'd need to make some database queries).

<div class="notranslate">

```
dbtop
```
</div>

10. If the load appears in the dbtop output, then you have successfully configured MySQL Governor.

## CloudLinux LVE and CageFS patches

:::tip Note
If you are using Apache from the CloudLinux repository (such as httpd or httpd24-httpd), skip this section.
:::

If you use custom Apache, you need to apply patches so that the processes launched by the Apache are working with LVE and CageFS properly. 
Cloudlinux provides patches for the following packages: 

* `suphp`
* `suexec`
* `php-fpm`
* `apr` library
* `Apache mpm itk`

First of all, download patches using the following link [https://repo.cloudlinux.com/cloudlinux/sources/da/cl-apache-patches.tar.gz](https://repo.cloudlinux.com/cloudlinux/sources/da/cl-apache-patches.tar.gz)

To apply the patch, follow these steps.

1. Untar archive which you were going to patch and go to the created directory with sources.

2. Transfer the patch to the directory with sources.

3. Use the patch utility inside the directory with sources

4. Recompile your project.

Here's an example with `apr` library:

<div class="notranslate">

```
# ls 
apr-1.4.8.tar.bz2  apr-2.4-httpd.2.patch
# tar xvjf apr-1.4.8.tar.bz2
# cp apr-2.4-httpd.2.patch ./apr-1.4.8
# cd ./apr-1.4.8
# patch -p3 < apr-2.4-httpd.2.patch 
patching file include/apr_thread_proc.h
Hunk #1 succeeded at 204 (offset -2 lines).
patching file threadproc/unix/proc.c

Patch applied Successfully, recompile apr. 
```

</div>

If you build custom RPM packages, it might make sense to apply patches using spec file.

In this case, add to the Source section (example for `apr`):

<div class="notranslate">

```
Source0: apr-1.4.8.tar.bz2
Patch100: apr-2.4-httpd.2.patch
```

</div>

Then  apply this patch in the <span class="notranslate">`%setup`</span> section:

<div class="notranslate">

```
%prep
%setup -q
%patch100 -p3 -b .lve
```
</div>

If no errors appear during the build, the patch has been successfully applied.

## Hardened PHP

All versions of alt-php should work properly in any control panel.

To install all PHP versions, run:

<div class="notranslate">

```
yum groupinstall alt-php
```
</div>

To install a particular version of PHP, run:

<div class="notranslate">

```
yum groupinstall alt-php{some_version}
```
</div>

For details, see [PHP Selector Installation and Update](/cloudlinux_os_components/#installation-and-update-4)

## CloudLinux kernel set-up

### /proc filesystem access control

* [Integrating control panel with CloudLinux](/control_panel_integration/#integrating-control-panel-with-cloudlinux)

CloudLinux kernel allows the server administrator to control the user access to the `/proc` filesystem with the special parameters.
Unprivileged system users will not be able to see the processes of other system users, they can only see their processes. See details [here](/cloudlinux_os_kernel/#virtualized-proc-filesystem).

If the <span class="notranslate">`fs.proc_can_see_other_uid`</span> parameter is not defined in `sysctl` config during the CageFS package installation, it is set to `0`: <span class="notranslate">`fs.proc_can_see_other_uid=0`</span>.

You can also set this parameter in the <span class="notranslate">`/etc/sysctl.conf`</span> file and then run the <span class="notranslate">`sysctl -p`</span> command.

<span class="notranslate">[`hidepid`](/cloudlinux_os_kernel/#remounting-procfs-with-hidepid-option)</span> parameter is set based on the <span class="notranslate">`fs.proc_can_see_other_uid`</span> parameter value automatically during the <span class="notranslate">`lve_namespaces`</span> service starting (i.e. during <span class="notranslate">`lve-utils`</span> package installation and server booting).

#### Integrating control panel with CloudLinux

Run the following command to add administrators into <span class="notranslate">`proc_super_gid`</span> group (if the panel administrator is not a root user or there are several administrators):

<div class="notranslate">

```
/usr/share/cloudlinux/hooks/post_modify_admin.py create --username <admin_name>
```
</div>

:::tip Note 
This administrator should exist as a system user.
:::

This command also adds a specified administrator to the <span class="notranslate">`clsudoers`</span> group, so the LVE Manager admin's plugin works properly.

This command is a hook that the control panel should call after adding the admin user to the system.

If the [admins](/control_panel_integration/#admins) list script exists when installing <span class="notranslate">`lve-utils`</span> package then the existing administrators will be processed automatically. It the script does not exist, you should run the above mentioned command for each administrator.

### Symlink protection

* [How to enable symlink protection](/control_panel_integration/#how-to-enable-symlink-protection)

CloudLinux kernels have symlink attacks protection. When this protection is enabled, the system does not allow users to create symlinks (and hard links) to non-existent/not their own files.

[Here](/cloudlinux_os_kernel/#link-traversal-protection) you can find all protection mechanism parameters.

See also: [the special module to protect web-server](/cloudlinux_os_kernel/#symlink-owner-match-protection).

You can run <span class="notranslate">`cldiag`</span> utility with the <span class="notranslate">`--check-symlinkowngid`</span> parameter to check whether your web-server protection mechanisms are correctly set-up.

<div class="notranslate">

```
# cldiag --symlinksifowner
Check fs.enforce_symlinksifowner is correctly enabled in sysctl conf:
	OK: fs.enforce_symlinksifowner = 1

There are 0 errors found.
# cldiag --check-symlinkowngid
Check fs.symlinkown_gid:
	OK: Web-server user is protected by Symlink Owner Match Protection

There are 0 errors found.
```
</div>

* Symlink traversal protection is disabled by default.
* Symlink owner match protection is enabled by default.

#### How to enable symlink protection

Set the <span class="notranslate">`symlinkown_gid`</span> parameter to the value of the GID group of the web-server process.

Before enabling symlink protection, ensure it does not break the control panel functionality.

For example, if an unprivileged user is allowed to create symlinks or hard links to files or directories he doesn’t own then when enabling symlink traversal protection he will not be able to do so.

To allow an unprivileged user to create such symlink or hard link, a file/directory which symlink is referred to should have <span class="notranslate">`linksafe`</span> group.

### File system quotas

Some of CloudLinux OS utilities (`cagefsctl`, `selectorctl`, `cloudlinux-selector`, etc) writes files to the user’s home directory on behalf of this user.

So they are subject to the disk quotas if any are set for the user. The utilities can override these quotas to avoid failures.
See [File system quotas](/cloudlinux_os_kernel/#file-system-quotas) for kernel parameters controlling these permissions. This parameter is used only for XFS file system.
