* [FAQ](/cloudlinux-os-plus/#faq)

### Description

:::warning Warning!
<span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> is available out of the box for cPanel, Plesk, and DirectAdmin. For other control panels you should implement integration as described [here](/control_panel_integration/#how-to-integrate-x-ray-with-a-control-panel)
:::

<span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> is a tool developed for website performance monitoring and performance issues detection.

<span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> can gather and visualize information about top N slowest system functions, external requests, software modules and database queries of the client’s website.

### Known limitations
<span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> is not compatible with Opcahce JIT optimization.
Once <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> tracing task is running for the site the Opcache JIT optimization will be disabled until tracing task completed.

### Installation

1. Make sure you have CloudLinux OS Shared Pro subscription (only non-reseller accounts apply)

2. Make sure you have installed **LVE Manager version 6.2 or later**. You can install or update it with the following commands:
   * installation

   <div class="notranslate">

    ```
    # yum install lvemanager
    ```
    </div>

    * update
   
   <div class="notranslate">

    ```
    # yum update lvemanager
    ```
    </div>
3. X-Ray will be activated on all your servers during 4 hours. You will see the X-Ray tab in the LVE Manager UI.

4. For instant activation, run the following command:

   <div class="notranslate">

    ```
    # rhn_check
    ```
    </div>

    If the `rhn_check` command is not found, run the following command:

    <div class="notranslate">

    ```
    # yum install rhn-check rhn-setup
    ```
    </div>

5. Then install the <span class="notranslate">`alt-php-xray`</span> package

    * Via user interface
        * Go to the <span class="notranslate">_X-Ray_</span> tab.
        * Click <span class="notranslate">_Install_</span> to start installation.

        ![](/images/XRayUI.png)

    * Via SSH by running the following command:
  
    <div class="notranslate">

    ```
    # yum install lvemanager alt-php-xray
    ```
    </div>

6. After installation, use the <span class="notranslate">_Start tracing_</span> button to create your first tracing task for a slow site.

![](/images/XRayStartTracing.png)

### How to manage X-Ray

X-Ray provides several options for monitoring domain requests speed: Manual Tracing task, X-Ray Autotracing and Continuous tracing.

* **Manual Tracing task** is a task that you can create for a specific URL to collect server requests. The task will end either after a specified number of requests to the URL or after a specified time (maximum after two days). It is not possible here to automatically email a report but it is possible to export the report in PDF and send to a user.

* **Autotracing task** is a task that will be created automatically at the end of each day for slow URLs that were found during that day by the [PHP Slow Site Analyzer](/lve_manager/#website-monitoring-tool-and-slow-site-analyzer) (SSA).
Need to be enabled separately, see [How to enable X-Ray Autotracing](/cloudlinux-os-plus/#how-to-enable-x-ray-autotracing).

* **Continuous tracing** is a task that initiates daily hourly tracing requests for a specified domain and email a monitoring report. Continuous task can't stop automatically, you need to stop it manually. In fact, continuous task allows to automatically create a tracing task for each new day, with the ability to get a report for the past day.

#### Tracing tasks tab

The *Tracing tasks* tab contains a list of all tracing tasks created both manually and automatically via continuous tasks.

![](/images/XRayTracingTaskCreated.png)

The *Created* column shows how a task was created – automatically (by continuous task) or manually.

#### Continuous tracing tab

:::warning Warning
To use Continuous task, update your LVE Manager and alt-PHP-X-Ray packages to versions lvemanager-6.2.9-1 and alt-php-xray-0.2-1 by running the following command:
```
yum update lvemanager alt-php-xray
```
::: 

The *Continuous tracing* tab contains a list of continuous tasks for which tracing tasks will be created automatically for a new day for a specific domain.

![](/images/XRayContinuousTasksList.png)

### Managing tracing task

#### Creating a new tracing task

1. Go to the <span class="notranslate">_X-Ray_</span> tab
2. Click the <span class="notranslate">_Start tracing_</span> button to create a new task
3. In the opened popup specify a website URL to trace
4. Click the <span class="notranslate">_Run_</span> button
5. Tracing will run in the default mode. In the default mode <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> traces the first 20 requests for a specified URL

![](/images/XRayTracingTask.png)

* <span class="notranslate">**URL**</span> should be a valid URL of the domain which exists on the current hosting server. The URL field supports wildcard matching. To learn more about wildcard matching, click _How to use special characters_.
* <span class="notranslate">**Advanced settings**</span> allow you to set an IP address and tracing options: by time or by number of queries.

    ![](/images/XRayAdvanced.png)

**Advanced settings**

* <span class="notranslate">**Client’s IP**</span>: it is an IPv4 address of a machine to trace. For example, if you have a production website that processes requests from different IP addresses and you do not want to add these requests to the tracing task. So, you can set a specific IP address and <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> will analyze requests only from this specific IP address.
Record for
* <span class="notranslate">**Time period**</span>: how much time <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> collect the requests (2 days max)
* <span class="notranslate">**Requests**</span>: the amount of requests that <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> will collect

After creating, the task appears in the list of tracing tasks.

![](/images/XRayTrcingTaskList.png)

#### Viewing tracing tasks list

![](/images/XRayTrcingTaskList1.png)

Tasks created *Manually* are simply tracing tasks.

#### Tracing status

A tracing task can have the following statuses:

* <span class="notranslate">**Running**</span> – tracing is in progress
* <span class="notranslate">**Stopped**</span> – tracing was stopped by administrator
* <span class="notranslate">**On hold**</span> – the same URL already exists in the lists. Task processing will not start automatically. Administrator should start it manually.
* <span class="notranslate">**Completed**</span> – period of time is finished or number of requests is reached.

#### Collected requests for tracing task

:::warning Warning!
Collected requests are available in the UI for two weeks.
:::

### X-Ray Autotracing

X-Ray Autotracing automatically creates tracing tasks for slow URLs that were found during a day by the [PHP Slow Site Analyzer](/lve_manager/#website-monitoring-tool-and-slow-site-analyzer) (SSA).

:::warning Warning
To use X-Ray Autotracing, update your alt-php-ssa and alt-php-xray packages to versions alt-php-ssa-0.2-1 and alt-php-xray-0.4-1 or higher by running the following command:
```
# yum update alt-php-ssa alt-php-xray --enablerepo=cloudlinux-updates-testing
```
:::

#### How to enable X-Ray Autotracing

To enable X-Ray Autotracing, run the following commands via SSH:

```
# /usr/sbin/cloudlinux-ssa-manager enable-ssa
# /usr/sbin/cloudlinux-autotracing enable --all
```

Check [CLI documentation](/command-line_tools/#x-ray-autotracing) for a description of the `/usr/sbin/cloudlinux-autotracing` CLI utility.

#### Requirements

* CloudLinux OS Shared Pro or CloudLinux OS Solo or CloudLinux OS Admin
* alt-php-ssa > 0.2-1 version
* alt-php-xray > 0.4-1 version
* Enabled PHP SSA on the server

#### Autotracing Interface

A new tab for Autotracing tasks was added to the X-Ray UI:


![](/images/XRayAutotracingtaskstab.png)


#### Autotracing FAQ

Q: Why are the slow URLs in the Slow Site Analyzer report different from those on which the autotracing tasks were created?

A: Because the autotracing decision module uses rules and thresholds different from Slow Site Analyzer, which are configured by the CloudLinux team.

Q: How often autotracing tasks will be generated?

A: Once a day at the same time as a Slow Site Analyzer report.

### X-Ray Smart Advice

Smart advice is a new feature of X-Ray that is designed to find and propose solutions to fix performance issues and speed up the performance of a sites.

:::tip Note
Smart Advice will work only for CloudLinux OS Shared Pro servers with cPanel Control Panel for now.

At the moment, Smart Advise is focused only on WordPress sites.
:::

:::warning Warning
To use X-Ray Smart Advice, update your alt-php-ssa and alt-php-xray packages to versions alt-php-ssa-0.2-3 and alt-php-xray-0.5-1 or higher by running the following command:
```
# yum update alt-php-ssa alt-php-xray lve-utils lvemanager --enablerepo=cloudlinux-updates-testing
```
:::

#### How to enable X-Ray Smart Advice

:::warning Attention!
If you'd like to try Smart Advice and AccelerateWP you should participate in the Beta tester program. To become a beta tester, please send your request at our Beta program page with the signup form [here](https://www.cloudlinux.com/wp-performance/). Once you submit the request, we will send you a confirmation email with program details and terms of use.
:::

#### Requirements

* CloudLinux OS Shared Pro or CloudLinux OS Solo
* alt-php-xray > 0.5-1 version
* lve-utils > 6.3.2-1 version
* lvemanager > 7.6.1-1 version
* cloudlinux-site-optimization-module > 0.1-1 version

We Recommend:

* Enable [X-Ray Autotracing](cloudlinux-os-plus/#x-ray-autotracing) on the server
* Use alt-php-ssa > 0.2-3 version

#### How X-Ray Smart Advice works

The main process of looking for advice is X-Ray tracing tasks. The best way for doing this is to enable X-Ray Autotracing. 
This will allow you to most effectively find Smart Advice for sites that have performance issues without your manual participation. 
You can find information on how to enable X-Ray Autotracing [here](/cloudlinux-os-plus/#how-to-enable-x-ray-autotracing).
On the other hand, you can create tracing tasks manually or use continuous X-Ray but we suggest you use X-Ray Autotracing for this purpose.

:::tip Note
Advice will not be generated by old tracing tasks.
:::

While the tracing task is running, X-Ray will look for places where advice can be applied. New advice will be displayed on the *Smart Advice* tab. 

![](/images/XRaySmartAdviceMainTab.png)

After the X-Ray finds advice you will see new advice in the *Review* status on the *Smart Advice* tab. 
Then you may use the *Details* button to see which URLs were found by X-Ray that will be speed up by that advice and use *Quick Action* to enable advice for a site.

Example of details:

![](/images/XRaySmartAdviceDetails.png)

After you apply the advice by using *Quick Action*, the status will change to the *Applied*.

If a long time has passed since the last time the advice was updated for a site, it will be moved to the *Outdated* status. 

:::tip Note
New X-Ray task may update *Outdated* advice if X-Ray finds performance issues that may be fixed by that advice. Then the status of advice becomes *Review*.
:::

If the process of applying advice fails you will see an error log with a detailed error, you may try to fix it manually and try again or [contact our support team for help](https://cloudlinux.zendesk.com/hc/en-us). 

Example when an error appears during advice applying:

![](/images/XRaySmartAdviceError.png)

#### Smart Advice FAQ

Q: Why I can't see new advice on the *Smart Advice* tab?

A: For the generating of advice, it is necessary to run X-Ray tracing tasks, the best way to do it without manual interaction is to use X-Ray Autoracing. You can find more information on how to enable X-Ray Autotracing [here](/cloudlinux-os-plus/#how-to-enable-x-ray-autotracing).

#### Useful Smart Advice CLI commands

:::warning Warning!
This is an experimental feature. The backwards compatibility is not guaranteed.
:::

To obtain the full list of advice generated for your server use the following CLI command:

```
cl-smart-advice list
```

For each advice in the list the CLI command returns the following information:
* `metadata`, which includes information about `username`, `domain` and `website` for which the advice is issued
* `advice` information:
  * its identifier `id`
  * its `type`
  * its `status` -- `review` or `applied`
  * if advice is Premium `is_premium`
  * other internal informational fields

The example output is given below:

### End-user X-Ray plugin

:::warning Warning
To use the end-user X-Ray plugin, update your LVE Manager and X-Ray packages to the `lvemanager-6.3.9-1` (or later) and `alt-php-xray-0.3-1` (or later) by running the following command:
```
# yum update lvemanager alt-php-xray
```
:::

#### How to enable/disable the end-user X-Ray plugin

You can hide or show the end-user X-Ray plugin icon by ticking or unticking the proper checkbox in the LVE Manager.

Go to _LVE Manager → Options Tab → User interface settings_.

![](/images/HideXRayAppCheckbox.png)

:::tip Note
The X-Ray plugin icon in the end-user interface is hidden when the checkbox is ticked.
:::

![](/images/XRayAppUIIcon.png)

#### How to manage the end-user X-Ray plugin

The web interface of the end-user X-Ray plugin is almost the same as the X-Ray administrator interface.

![](/images/XRayEndUserUI.png)

But there are some differences and they are described further.

* End-users can create tasks only for their domains from the drop-down list:
    ![](/images/XRayEndUserUIStart.png)
* To specify URL or wildcard, end-users should use the input field next to the domain:
    ![](/images/XRayEndUserUiSpecifyURL.png)

You can read about all other basic interface elements and managing tracing tasks in the [Managing tracing task section](/cloudlinux-os-plus/#managing-tracing-task).

:::tip Note
Tracing tasks created by an end-user will also be displayed in the administrator interface and administrators can manage the end-user's tasks the same way as they manage their own. At the same time, tasks created by the administrator or other end-users will not be displayed in the UI of the current user.
:::

#### End-user X-Ray plugin limitations

* The end-user X-Ray plugin does not support creating continuous tasks.
* The end-user has a limit of tracing tasks running at a time. Before starting the next task, the end-user should wait for the completion of the previous ones or forcefully stop the running ones. Otherwise, the user will get the next error:
    
    ![](/images/XRayEndUserUIError.png)
    :::tip Note
    The current limit is one tracing task per user. 
    :::
* The administrator and the end-user can’t run the tracing task for the same Domain/URL at the same time. Once, the administrator started a specific tracing task, the end-user will not be able to duplicate it. And the same is true for the administrators – they will just see the running task for the specific domain and see the notification that they're trying to create a tracing task with a duplicated URL.
* If continuous tracing is enabled for the domain, the end-user will not be able to create a new task for this domain because the same rule works - it will be a duplicate of the existing tracing tasks. The next warning will appear:
    
    ![](/images/XRayEndUserUIWarning.png)

    To solve this, the existing running tasks for the same Domain/URL should be stopped or completed. You can find more details about this in the [FAQ](/cloudlinux-os-plus/#what-should-i-do-if-i-see-the-warning-task-is-duplicated-by-url).

* If a user's tracing task was created for a domain which is using the FPM handler there's an additional limitation.  To avoid  frequent reloads of the particular FPM service, **Start tracing** ,  **Stop tracing** or  **Continue tracing** action would be blocked in case if the latest reload of a corresponding FPM service was done less than 1 minute ago.  
If a user gets such an error message - it means that  1 reload  in  1 minute for a particular FPM service has been already done.  Just try performing the same operation once again in a while.

### X-Ray automated throttling detection

:::tip Note
**CPU throttling detection** is available since `alt-php-xray-0.3-2` and `lvemanager-xray-0.5-2`.

**IO/IOPS throttling detection** is available since `alt-php-xray-0.3-7` and `lvemanager-xray-0.7-1`.

- `kmod-lve-2.0-23` (and later) for CloudLinux OS Shared 8 or CloudLinux OS Shared 7 hybrid
- `kernel-1.5-58` (and later) for CloudLinux OS Shared 7 or CloudLinux OS Shared 6 hybrid

are also required to utilize the feature of **IO/IOPS throttling detection**.
:::

:::warning Warning
X-Ray automated throttling detection feature is not supported for CloudLinux OS Shared 6
:::

The X-Ray automated throttling detection system checks if the account exceeds LVE limits by CPU or by IO/IOPS during the HTTP request execution. Requests with exceeded LVE limits are indicated in both X-Ray Administrator and X-Ray User plugins.

If CPU limiting was detected for a particular request, it is indicated in the X-Ray UI that the system itself has slowed down the request processing due to CPU throttling and this is apparently not a performance issue in the PHP code.

If limiting by IO and IOPS in total was detected for a particular request, it is indicated in the X-Ray UI in the same manner, except for the cause of slowing down the request -- IO throttling.

The case of both limiting for the request is also possible.

![](/images/CPUIOLimiting.png)

Requests with exceeded LVE limits are also marked in the request detailed view.

![](/images/RequestDetails.png)

Requests with exceeded LVE limits are marked in the PDF report as well.

![](/images/PDFReport.png)


### X-Ray client

<span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> client is a PHP extension named <span class="notranslate">`xray.so`</span>. It analyzes the processing time of the entire request and its parts and then sends the data to the <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> agent.

### X-Ray agent 


This is a service that receives data from the <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> client and sends it to the remote storage.

#### Managing X-Ray service

The <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> agent is managed by the <span class="notranslate">`service`</span> utility.

* To start the <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> agent, run the following command:

    <div class="notranslate">

    ```
    # service xray-agent start
    ```
    </div>

* To stop the <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> agent, run the following command:

    <div class="notranslate">

    ```
    # service xray-agent stop
    ```
    </div>

* To restart the <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> agent, run the following command:

    <div class="notranslate">

    ```
    # service xray-agent restart
    ```
    </div>

### FAQ

#### Does X-Ray affect website performance?

<span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> affects website performance. Our tests show 5-10 % overhead from a website loading time with <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> tracing enabled.
<span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> allows you to find website performance issues and should not be enabled permanently. If your website is very slow, you can enable <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> to find the cause and then disable it.

#### What should I do if I see the warning "Task is duplicated by URL"?

This warning means that you already have a task to trace this URL in the list of your tracing tasks. If you see this warning, a new task can be created only with the <span class="notranslate">_On hold_</span> status and you will be able to run it only when the previous task with the same URL will be completed.

Note that the URL field supports wildcard matching and you can have a case when <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> is tracing the <span class="notranslate">`URL=domain.com/*`</span> and you are trying to create a new task with <span class="notranslate">`URL=domain.com/xray.php`</span>. In this case, you will see that warning because the `*` URLs array includes <span class="notranslate">`xray.php`</span>.

####  I started a tracing task and made requests to URL but did not see any results in the UI. What should I do?

1. <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> may not send data if a site uses a caching plugin, as the caching plugin is outputting HTML, thus there are no PHP scripts to examine. We encountered such issues with sites that use <span class="notranslate">LSCache</span> and <span class="notranslate">WP Super Cache</span> plugins. Check that your site does not use caching plugins. If so, disable it while tracing a site to get information from <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span>. Moreover, it can also be because of caching on server side, for example NGINX Cache. Or when using CDN because requests are processed from another host. In such cases, during tracing, caching must also be disabled.
2. If you set a client’s IP when creating the tracing task, check that your requests come to the server with this IP via phpinfo (since there may be NAT between your local machine and the server).
   
    ![](/images/XRayPHPInfoRemoteAddr.png)

3. Check that <span class="notranslate">**xray**</span> extension is enabled for the domain. To do so, go to the <span class="notranslate">`phpinfo()`</span> page and make a request. In the phpinfo output try to find the following section:
   
    ![](/images/XRayPHPInfo.png)

If you cannot see that section, try to restart PHP processes for that user (the simplest way is to restart Apache) and check that you can see the <span class="notranslate">**xray**</span> extension.

4. If you can see the <span class="notranslate">**xray**</span> extension in the phpinfo, check that <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> agent service is running with the service xray-agent status command. If it is not running, start it with the <span class="notranslate">`service xray-agent start`</span> command.

5. If, after checking the previous items, the issue persists, [contact our support team](https://cloudlinux.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).

#### What to do if X-Ray is not found in the phpinfo() page?

If you managed to create a tracing task, this means that the <span class="notranslate">`xray.ini`</span> file was created in a system. Therefore, there may be two reasons why it did not appear in the phpinfo page of the domain.

1. PHP process wasn't reloaded after adding the xray.ini. To solve this, you should restart the Apache or fpm service for the domain on which the tracing was started. At the moment, this is done automatically by the <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> manager after creating the task.
2. Your domain uses a PHP version different from the one which was detected by the <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> manager. To solve this, check the scan dir for additional ini files for your domain.

    ![](/images/XRayScanDir.png)

    Then check the <span class="notranslate">`ini_location`</span> that was passed to the <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> manager by running the following command:

    <div class="notranslate">

    ```
    # cat /usr/share/alt-php-xray/manager.log | grep ini_location
    ```
    </div>

    Find your tracing task in the output and check that the <span class="notranslate">`xray.ini`</span> exists in this directory, also check that the `ini` path is the same in the phpinfo page output and in the <span class="notranslate">`ini_location`</span> directive for your tracing task. If they are the same, you should reload your PHP. If they are different that means that the <span class="notranslate">X-Ray</span> manager could not correctly determine the PHP version your domain uses. In this case, contact our support team at [https://cloudlinux.zendesk.com/hc/requests/new](https://cloudlinux.zendesk.com/hc/requests/new).


#### I use LiteSpeed, X-Ray is enabled and it is shown in the phpinfo() page but does not collect data when sending requests to a site. What to do?

Check for the <span class="notranslate">`CacheLookup on`</span> option in the `htaccess` file for your domain.
If the option is there, LiteSpeed processes requests bypassing the PHP X-Ray extension.
In this case, to get tracing information, you should remove the <span class="notranslate">`CacheLookup on`</span> option.

#### What is the proper format for the URL?

All of the examples below are correct:

* `http://domain.com`
* `http://domain.com/`
* `https://domain.com`
* `https://domain.com/`

You can use any of them with a prefix `www.` and it is also correct.

#### What packages are required for X-Ray?

Required packages:

* `lvemanager` >= 6.2.10-1
* `alt-php-xray` >= 0.2-1

### Description

<span class="notranslate">Centralized Monitoring</span> is a tool that allows hosting administrators to monitor load for all their servers and users.

<span class="notranslate">Centralized Monitoring</span> allows you to:

* View system metrics for all clients’ end servers
* View the LVE statistics per user for all clients’ end servers

### Installation

:::tip Note
Make sure that `cm.cloudlinux.com` is available on your end server.
:::

1. Make sure you have a CloudLinux OS Shared Pro subscription.
2. Make sure you have installed the **lve-utils** package version 4.2.21-2 or later. You can install or update it with the following commands:
    * installation
    ```
    yum install lve-utils
    ```
    * update
    ```
    yum update lve-utils
    ```
3. Log in to the [https://cm.cloudlinux.com/](https://cm.cloudlinux.com/) using CLN credentials (if you are already logged in via CLN, authorization via CM is not necessary, it uses SSO).
4. Activate statistics collection on all your servers via the Centralized Monitoring UI ([https://cm.cloudlinux.com](https://cm.cloudlinux.com)) or via the CLN UI [https://cln.cloudlinux.com/console/cloudlinux/centralized-monitoring](https://cln.cloudlinux.com/console/cloudlinux/centralized-monitoring).
    ![](/images/CMInstallationProd.png)
5. Within 5 hours from the activation, statistics collection and sending to the central server will be set up automatically: all required packages and components will be installed. For new, just registered servers, statistics collection and sending will be set up automatically within 5 hours.
6. Make sure you have activated statistics collection (see paragraph 4) otherwise you will not be able to set up your servers. For instant set up of a registered server after statistics collection was enabled, run the following commands for all servers:
    ```
    # rhn_check	
    # /usr/share/cloudlinux/cl_plus/manage_clplus enable
    ```
    **Note**: If the `rhn_check` command is not found, run the following command:
    ```
    # yum install/update rhn-check rhn-setup
    ```
7. After 5 hours (or after the manual setup), check that statistics for all registered servers is collected via [https://cm.cloudlinux.com/#/servers](https://cm.cloudlinux.com/#/servers). And check that user statistics on the servers is collected via [https://cm.cloudlinux.com/#/users](https://cm.cloudlinux.com/#/users).
    :::tip Note
    User statistics will be available only for users that were loaded starting from connecting the server to the Centralized Monitoring.
    :::


### Centralized Monitoring: mode without session expired

Users can monitor server’s or user’s load for a long time using the mode without session expired.

To turn on the mode without session expired, follow the next steps:

1. Log in to the [cln.cloudlinux.com](https://cln.cloudlinux.com/console/) via your account
2. Open the [cm.cloudlinux.com](https://cm.cloudlinux.com/#/servers) in a new browser tab/window (please, use the same browser as in step 1)
3. Use the toggle to turn on/off 10 min auto logout

    ![](/images/AutoLogout.png)

Your session in the [cln.cloudlinux.com](https://cln.cloudlinux.com/console/) will expire in 10 min. But your session in the [cm.cloudlinux.com](https://cm.cloudlinux.com/#/servers) will not expire while your browser tab remains open.


### Centralized Monitoring user interface


You can access <span class="notranslate">Centralized Monitoring</span> in your [CLN account](https://cln.cloudlinux.com/).
Click <span class="notranslate">C-Monitoring</span> in the left menu.

![](/images/CMCLNAccount.png)

#### Servers


This page contains the list of all clients’ end servers. The server appears in the list after finishing [Installation](/cloudlinux-os-plus/#installation-2). By default, there is a descending sort by CPU usage.

![](/images/CMAllServers.png)

The following values are available for each server:

* <span class="notranslate">**Load Avg 15m**</span> – average system load for the last 15 min
* <span class="notranslate">**CPU Usage**</span> – CPU usage for the last 15 min (the number of cores can be found in the hint)
* <span class="notranslate">**Memory Usage**</span> – free available memory, the second value is the total memory for the last 15 min
* <span class="notranslate">**IO read/write**</span> – disk read bytes/disk written bytes for the last 15 min

:::tip Note
The values are calculated using a 15 min time period but the metric state is updated automatically every minute by default or you can choose from one of the predefined periods.
:::

* <span class="notranslate">**Idle state**</span> – there were no statistics for the server for the last minute. 
* <span class="notranslate">**N/A state**</span> – there were no statistics for the server for the last 30 days. This can happen if a new server was added but statistics sending was not configured.

There is no pagination on the <span class="notranslate">_All servers_</span> page and all columns can be sorted by absolute value.
Use the search tool to operate with the data.

#### Servers details

To get the detailed statistics for the server via charts, click a desired server line in the table.
All charts are auto-refreshed and there is an ability to select the period for metrics data to be updated for the chart.

![](/images/CMUPdates.png)

:::warning Note
We store the metrics data for one month only.

:::warning Note
In the current version, we collect these metrics for the cPanel end servers only. We are planning to add other panels support soon.
:::

:::warning Note
In the current version, we collect these metrics only for Apache (NOT for LiteSpeed, Nginx, etc.). The charts will be empty for LiteSpeed, Nginx, etc..
:::

#### MySQL queries

![](/images/CMMySQLQueries.png)

MySQL queries collector gets number of queries executed on the server per minute. It takes data from the MySQL server variable "Questions". You may manually check variable value by executing query `SHOW GLOBAL STATUS LIKE 'Questions';`. For more information about MySQL server variables - please, see MySQL documentation.

#### The most loaded server users for the last minute

![](/images/CMMostLoadedUsers.png)

We calculate the user’s load by LVE statistics that we collect on the end server.
The idle state for the user means that the LVE statistics were not collected for the last minute for some reason.

In each cell there are current usage/limit values for the basic LVE limits:

* CPU Usage
* Entry Processes
* Physical Memory Usage
* IOPS
* IO Usage
* Number of Processes
* MySQL CPU
* MySQL IO

In the hint, there is a number of faults for each limit. The values in the columns are underlined (it is red if load-to-limit ratio >=90%  and it is yellow if load-to-limit ratio >= 50%). For the current implementation, the only sort by the load-to-limit ratio is available.
By default, there is a descending sort by the CPU usage column.

When sorting by a column, the lines with the load-to-limit ratio >=90% for this column will have the red background color, and lines with the load-to-limit ratio >=50% for this column will have the yellow background color.

:::tip Note
The users with unlimited resources (∞) will be at the bottom of the table. 
:::

#### Users

This page contains all users for the all server of the client and their LVE statistics for the last minute. You can select the number of users on this page and search by user’s data.

The description of this page is the same as [*The most loaded server users for the last minute*](/cloudlinux-os-plus/#the-most-loaded-server-users-for-the-last-minute) of the top 5 loaded users.


![](/images/CMUsers.png)

User’s metrics data can be sorted by the load-to-limit ratio and by the absolute value.

The absolute value is used to analyse the load produced by unlimited users.

The value of the load-to-limit ratio is convenient to use in the analysis of how many resources the users consume and whether they need to change the limits.

The values like this ![](/images/CMvalue.png) means that the resource is unlimited and 500.2 MB is the current usage of it.

Metrics data of _Idle users_ is not used in the sorting, so such users always will be at the end of the list.  The sorting can be done for only one metric.

#### Charts for Users metrics 

:::warning Note
We store the metrics data for one month only.
:::

On the user details page, the admin can find the charts for all LVE limits.

![](/images/CMUsersCharts.png)


### Alert Manager

Alert Manager allows you to create a server or user alert for selected metrics and email the triggered events.

#### Alert Manager page

![](/images/CMAlertManager1.png)

The Alert Manager page contains a table with the following:

* **Alert name** - a unique alert name
* **Tracking metric** - a name of a server/user metric which will trigger the alert notification
* **# of servers** - number of servers on which the metric will be tracked
  * click ![](/images/CMAlertManager2.png) to view a list of servers host names
* **# of users** - number of users for which the metric will be tracked
  * click ![](/images/CMAlertManager2.png) to view a list of users names
* **Value** - a condition for the alert rule which will be applied to the tracking metrics
* **Email** - email to send the triggered events notifications
* **Type** - a type of the alert rule
* **# of triggered events** - the number of events from the time, when alert rule was created
  * ![](/images/CMAlertManager3.png) the event is still firing
* **Time  of the last trigger** - the time of last triggered event, it is the time in your browser time zone
* **Actions** - click ![](/images/CMAlertManager4.png) to edit and ![](/images/CMAlertManager5.png) to delete the alert rule

**Color Codes**

* **Red** color means that the event with the condition "more than" is still firing.
* **Green** color means that the event with the condition "less than" is still firing.

#### Creating an alert

To create a new alert, click the _Create alert_ button.

![](/images/CMAlertManager7.png)

Next, fill out the opened popup.

![](/images/CMAlertManager6.png)

* **Name of alert** - a unique alert name
* **Alert type** - an admin can create a **user** or a **server** alert. [What is the difference between them?](/cloudlinux-os-plus/#difference-between-the-server-alert-and-the-user-alert)
* **Select user/server** - admin will see such dropdown depending on a [case of alert creating](/cloudlinux-os-plus/#cases-of-alert-creating)
* **Notify me** - the condition of the alert trigger
* **Duration** - how much time the condition should be actual to trigger the notification
* **Notify me on email** - the email to send notifications

#### Editing an alert

An admin can edit any field in the Alert except the Alert type.

#### Difference between the server alert and the user alert

The **server alert** is used to track the state of the  whole server, it does not track user state on the server.
The **server alert** tracks the next list of metrics:

1. Context switches
2. System load (1m)
3. System load (5m)
4. System load (15m)
5. CPU Basic (total)
6. CPU Basic (system)

32. Hardware Temperature (`sensor<N>`)
33. Open File Description

During creating a server alert an admin should select the type of metrics as the first step. The list of servers will be collected according to the availability of these metrics on the server.

For example, for now, we do not collect Apache metrics for non-cPanel servers, so you will get only cPanel servers as a list of servers for these metrics.

We're planning to implement support for other panels/web servers in the next releases.

:::tip Small limitation
We collect the server list according to having their statistics in our database (this behavior will be changed in the next releases).
:::

For example, if server state is N/A or idle more than 24 hours, it will not be visible in the list for the alert.

The **user alert** tracks the next list of LVE metrics:

1. CPU Usage (current usage)
2. CPU Usage (faults)
3. Entry Processes (current usage)
4. Entry Processes (faults)
5. Physical Memory Usage (current usage)
6. Physical Memory Usage (faults)
7. IOPS (current usage)
8. IOPS (faults)
9. IO Usage (current usage)
10. IO Usage (faults)
11. Number of Processes (current usage)
12. Number of Processes (faults)
13. MySQL CPU (current usage)
14. MySQL CPU (faults)
15. MySQL IO (current usage)

:::tip Small limitation
We collect the server list according to having their statistics in our database (this behavior will be changed in the next releases).
:::

For example, if the user state is N/A or idle more than 24 hours, it will not be visible in the list for the alert.

#### Cases of alert creating

* Creating a server alert for the selected metrics for one server
* Creating a server alert for the selected metrics for all servers (the default value)
  
In this two cases, you will not see the dropdown for selecting users because the metrics will track the server state. 

* Creating a user alert for one user, so admin can select a server and a user.
* Creating a user alert for all users on several servers/all servers (in this case admin can't select users - all users will be selected automatically)

#### What is the Firing state of the alert?

This is the state of an alert that has been active for longer than the configured threshold duration.


#### Alert notifications

* **Firing target** - the link to the server details page



### FAQ

### Troubleshooting

#### I can't see a server statistics

1. Check that your server is registered by key or by IP license of the CloudLinux+ account, i.e., it should be seen in the list of servers in your CLN account here: [https://cln.cloudlinux.com/console/auth/login](https://cln.cloudlinux.com/console/auth/login)
2. Check that the following required packages are installed on the end server:
* <span class="notranslate">`cl-end-server-tools`</span> >= 1.0.7-1
* <span class="notranslate">`cl-node-exporter`</span> >= 1.1.0-2
* <span class="notranslate">`rhn-client-tools`</span>
    * CloudLinux OS Shared 6 >= 1.1.15-3.el6.cloudlinux.26
    * CloudLinux OS Shared 7 >= 2.0.2-31.el7.clouldinux
    * CloudLinux OS Shared 8 >= 2.8.16-14.module_el8.1.0+6074+9dc6073e.cloudlinux.2
* <span class="notranslate">`lve-stats`</span> >= 3.0.7-2
* <span class="notranslate">`lve-utils`</span> >= 4.2.21-2
* <span class="notranslate">`alt-python27-cllib`</span> >= 2.1.13-1
* `lvemanager` >= 6.2.10-1
3. Check that service collecting and sending statistics is running:

<div class="notranslate">

```
service cl_plus_sender status
```
</div>

4. Check that log of the <span class="notranslate">_cl_plus_sender_</span> service doesn't contain errors:
   
<div class="notranslate">

```
/var/log/clplus_sender.log
```
</div>

#### Where can I view the events log on the client's server?

You can view the events log on the client's server here: 

<div class="notranslate">

```
/var/log/clplus_sender.log
```
</div>

#### Can I get monitoring metrics from LiteSpeed, Nginx or other (Not Apache) web server?

Starting from end-server-tools-1.0.7, it supports collecting and sending statistics from the Apache and LiteSpeed web servers.

LiteSpeed is supported on cPanel and DirectAdmin control panels.

Each minute the statistics collection daemon checks which web server is started. If LiteSpeed is started, the daemon will collect data from it, otherwise, it checks if Apache is started.

When the daemon detects that the server is changed, it writes the following line into the statistics collection daemon log `/var/log/clplus_sender.log`:

```
2020-10-09 17:25:31,462: (CL+_sender_daemon) [INFO] Apache/Litespeed collector: Using Apache
```
or

```
2020-10-09 18:13:03,897: (CL+_sender_daemon) [INFO] Apache/Litespeed collector: Using Litespeed
```

If the daemon can't detect either Apache or LiteSpeed, it writes to the log the following:

```
2020-10-09 17:33:38,399: (CL+_sender_daemon) [INFO] Apache/Litespeed collector: Apache or Litespeed stopped or absent, collector will not work
```

The statistics collection daemon reacts to the server changing automatically, no need to restart it.

:::warning Warning
Please note that the daemon checks the server type once in a minute, so the data sent on a minute of switching can be unreliable.
:::

#### Logging data sent to pushgateway to the statistics collection daemon log

Starting from `cl-end-server-tools` v.1.0.6-1, the statistics collection daemon allows to log data sent to pushgateway to its log `/var/log/clplus_sender.log`.

To start logging, run the following command: 

```
touch /var/lve/cmt_debug_logging
```

To stop logging, run the following command: 

```
rm -f /var/lve/cmt_debug_logging
```

You don't need to restart the daemon after starting/stopping logging. The presence of a control file is evaluated "on the fly".

:::warning Warning
Use this logging with caution because when it is enabled, the size of the daemon log `/var/log/clplus_sender.log` will increase each minute minimum on 3-4 KB. The actual increase size depends on the number of active users' processes on a server.

### Known issues

* MySQL Governor statistics in some cases is collected incorrectly
* Sorting by MySQL Governor statistics ignores idle users
* Sorting from the search result set does not work
* Sorting by ratio for unlimited users works incorrectly


## AccelerateWP

### Get started

AccelerateWP carries a suite of optimization features that can be enabled and automatically configured for the end-user's site.

There are AccelerateWP and AccelerateWP Premium feature suites.

AccelerateWP suite is always enabled when AccelerateWP is turned on. Choose whether you want to offer AccelerateWP Premium 
for your users and click "Turn on" to start exploring AccelerateWP. 

![](./images/awp/AWPGettingStarted.png)

Once the AccelerateWP suite is enabled by administrator,
end-users will see an AccelerateWP tab in their cPanel interface and be able to activate the optimization feature.

When AccelerateWP Premium suite enabled by administrator, 
end-users will see the Object Caching feature in their interface, 
but cannot install the plugin unless they purchase the feature using [WHMCS or 3'd party billing](#billing-integration).

#### AccelerateWP suite
This is a basic suite which includes [AccelerateWP base feature](https://user-docs.cloudlinux.com/wpos-plugin/#acceleratewp-feature-wordpress-optimization-plugin): 
a WordPress optimization plugin that provides full page caching, GZIP compression and some other useful optimizations.

**AccelerateWP suite limitations**
* the website must be served with Apache web server;
* the website must use PHP version 7.2 or higher.
* the WordPress version must be 5.7 and higher.
* the other WordPress Caching plugins must not be installed.
* the WordPress should not run in Multisite mode.

#### AccelerateWP Premium suite

:::warning Attention
This feature is free of charge only during the beta testing period. 
Afterwards it will be charged. Beta testing period ends no earlier than March 2023.
:::

This is a premium suite which includes [Object Caching feature](https://user-docs.cloudlinux.com/wpos-plugin/#acceleratewp-premium-object-caching-feature).

The Object Caching mechanism stores database query results in additional storage for quick access. 
This mechanism is really helpful in case if website needs to process multiple pages per second as 
requests come in and may be helpful in case when full page caching cannot be used, e.g. on personalized pages.

**Premium suite limitations**

* the website must be served with Apache web server;
* the website must use one of the following PHP handlers:
  * [php-fpm](https://blog.cpanel.com/how-to-use-php-fpm-with-cpanel/)
  * [lsapi](/cloudlinux_os_components/#apache-mod-lsapi-pro)
* the website must use PHP version 7.2 or higher.
* the WordPress version must be 3.7 and higher.
* the other WordPress Caching plugins must not be installed.
* the [Snuffleupagus](https://snuffleupagus.readthedocs.io/) must be turned off.
* the WordPress should not run in Multisite mode.


### Limitations
There are the following requirements to use AccelerateWP:
* the server must have CloudLinux Shared PRO license;
* the server must be powered with cPanel or Plesk.


### Administrator interface

#### Overview
In the _CloudLinux Manager → AccelerateWP_ tab an administrator has the opportunity to provide end-users with a suite of features, which on its turn could be activated by end-users.
To provide best experience,
[activate free features for all end-users](/cloudlinux-os-plus/#activate-free-acceleratewp-for-all-wp-sites-on-the-server).

![](/images/AWPAdmin.png)

By toggling the `Enable AccelerateWP for all users` an administrator provides end-users with AccelerateWP feature.
Once the feature suite is enabled by administrator, end-users will see an AccelerateWP tab in their control panel interface and be able to activate the optimization feature.

#### Suites usage statistics
When AccelerateWP is enabled, the AccelerateWP usage statistics is shown.

![](./images/awp/AWPStats.png)

It includes:
* `Active Users` block with total number of users and number of users who has activated the optimization feature/total users
* `Wordpress sites on server` block with total number of WordPress sites and WordPress sites optimized by the feature
* statistics table

Each row in the statistics table represents a particular user.

The first column `#of Wordpress sites` shows total number of user's WordPress sites.

The second column `AccelerateWP` shows number of user's WordPress sites, optimized by the feature.

To enable premium features, click on the "Activate premium features" link and select the options you want. To integrate functions with billing, you must specify the base URL for the purchase of the function by end users.

![](./images/awp/AWPPremiumManage.png)

In case if both AccelerateWP and AccelerateWP Premium feature suites are enabled, 
the statistics is extended with AccelerateWP Premium metrics.

![](./images/awp/AWPStatsPremium.png)

Please notice the `AccelerateWP Premium` rows in the `Active Users` and the `Wordpress sites on server` 
blocks, and also the `AccelerateWP Premium` column in statistics table.

:::tip Note
Newly created users will be accounted for 10 min after adding. 
If you want to get updated statistics immediately, use the "Rescan users websites" button.
:::

#### Filters
You may use the following filters to browse AccelerateWP statistics slices.

![](./images/awp/AWPFilters.png)

* `Users with WordPress sites only` filter will show statistics for users which already have WordPress sites; users without WordPress installations will be hidden
* `Users with AccelerateWP only` filter will show statistics for users who utilizes the AccelerateWP optimization feature; users who did not activated AccelerateWP feature will be hidden
* `Users with AccelerateWP Premium only` filter will show statistics for users who utilizes AccelerateWP Premium (Object Caching) feature; users who did not activated AccelerateWP Premium feature will be hidden
* `Users with CDN Free only` filter will show statistics for users who utilizes AccelerateWP CDN feature
* `Users with CDN Pro only` filter will show statistics for users who utilize AccelerateWP CDN Pro feature


### Activate free AccelerateWP for all WordPress sites on the server
Use the `cloudlinux-awp-admin enable-feature` CLI command to
ensure the best performance for every end-user. CLI command
scans a server for all WordPress sites and activates the AccelerateWP
feature suite. It can take up to 2 minutes for a single site. CLI command skips activation for WordPress sites with
page caching or feature incompatibilities.

:::tip Note
Please make sure your AccelerateWP version is >= 1.2-2 before proceed.
:::

Scan the server in background mode and activate AccelerateWP
on those WordPress sites where it is possible:
```
cloudlinux-awp-admin enable-feature --all
```
The output will state the number of users for the scan and the
progress state of the process.

Check activation status:
```
cloudlinux-awp-admin enable-feature --status
```
The output will be either:
* Activation is still in progress,
* Activation is done. The message will state how many users
were initially for the scan, a number of WordPress sites with
successfully activated suite, and the total number of WordPress sites
scanned.

### Enable AccelerateWP CDN Pro

To enable CDN Pro for all users:
```
cloudlinux-awp-admin set-suite --suites accelerate_wp_cdn_pro --users all --allowed-for-all
```

To enable CDN Pro for a particular user:
```
cloudlinux-awp-admin set-suite --suites accelerate_wp_cdn_pro --allowed --users=<username>
```

### Disable AccelerateWP for a particular user
Use CLI commands to disable undesired optimization suites for a single user.

To disable AccelerateWP suite:
```
cloudlinux-awp-admin set-suite --suites=accelerate_wp --disallowed --users=<username>
```

To disable AccelerateWP Premium suite:
```
cloudlinux-awp-admin set-suite --suites=accelerate_wp_premium --disallowed --users=<username>
```

To disable AccelerateWP CDN suite:
```
cloudlinux-awp-admin set-suite --suite=accelerate_wp_cdn --disallowed --users=<username>
```

To disable AccelerateWP CDN Pro suite:
```
cloudlinux-awp-admin set-suite --suite=accelerate_wp_cdn_pro --disallowed --users=<username>
```

To disable all suites:
```
cloudlinux-awp-admin set-suite --suites=accelerate_wp,accelerate_wp_premium,accelerate_wp_cdn,accelerate_wp_cdn_pro --disallowed --users=<username>
```

### Useful AccelerateWP CLI commands
Use CLI commands to check AccelerateWP features status.

#### AccelerateWP features detailed statistics

AccelerateWP features detailed statistics is available in user's environment only.

Use the following CLI command **_on behalf of a user_**:

```
cloudlinux-awp-user get
```

The command reports:
* features allowed for a user -- `allowed_features`
* all user's websites `docroots` with features information per each `wps`, which includes:
  * status of each feature -- if the feature is `enabled`, if the feature is `visible`
  * issues detected (if any) for each feature
* subscription status (for premium features) -- `subscription`
* features visible for a user -- `visible_features`

The example output is given below:

```

Check out [the documentation](https://docs.cln.cloudlinux.com/whmcs_awp_plugin/) to find how to install and use the plugin.

### Other billing integration

As AccelerateWP Premium is the feature that works on subscription basis, 
we made it possible for hosters to integrate their existing billing systems with our plugin and sell the 
feature for their users.

When AccelerateWP Premium is enabled in admin interface, users get proposal to upgrade their subscription.

![](./images/awp/AWPUpgradeNoLink.png)

When user upgrades the subscription to the plan with AccelerateWP support, 
billing must execute the following command on the server:
```
cloudlinux-awp-admin set-suite --suites=accelerate_wp_premium --allowed --source=BILLING_OVERRIDE --users=<username>
```

This command makes two things:
- allow user to install plugin, bypassing the upgrade window;
- reports premium as being used to CLN, starting the billing cycle for hoster.


When user terminates or downgrades plan, the following command must be executed by the billing system:
```
cloudlinux-awp-admin set-suite --suites=accelerate_wp_premium --default --source=BILLING_OVERRIDE --users=<username>
```

### Setup upgrade URL for AccelerateWP Premium

The upgrade window can be customized with link to the plan upgrade page, which can be set using CLI command:

```
cloudlinux-awp-admin set-options --upgrade-url https://plan.upgrade/splash
```

![](./images/awp/AWPUpgradeLink.png)

AccelerateWP automatically appends GET parameters when the link is displayed.

```
https://plan.upgrade/splash/?m=acceleratewp&action=provisioning&username=democom&domain=demo.com&server_ip=10.51.0.10
```

| Parameter | Value        | Description                                              |
|-----------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| m         | acceleratewp | Constant.                                                |
| action    | provisioning | Constant.                                                |
| username  | democom      | Customer's account name.                                 |
| domain    | demo.com     | Customer's account primary domain.                       |
| server_ip | 10.51.0.10   | Primary IP of the server where AccelerateWP is installed |

Parameters can be used to determine the billing account of the user in order to display proper page. 
WHMCS plugin already has automatic redirect to upgrade page, there is only needed to set upgrade-url 
to the root of your WHMCS instance.

```
cloudlinux-awp-admin set-options --upgrade-url https://whmcs.mydomain.zone/
```

Upgrade URL is opened in modal browser window and will be automatically closed
when AccelerateWP receives callback about successful upgrade.

Callback is already implemented in WHMCS plugin, but if you are using some other billing,
you should add the following code on the page which appears when user successfully upgrades subscription.

    <script>
    if(window.opener && !window.opener.closed) {
        window.opener.postMessage('PAYMENT_SUCCESS', '*');
    }
    </script>


In order to remove the link, just set upgrade url to the empty one.

```
cloudlinux-awp-admin set-options --upgrade-url ''
```

### Disable AccelerateWP Premium

If you would like to stop using AccelerateWP Premium, 
click on the `manage` link and remove `Premium Features` checkbox.
AccelerateWP will be still available for your users.

![](./images/awp/AWPDisablePremiumOnly.png)

### Disable AccelerateWP

If you would like to stop using AccelerateWP completely, toggle the `AccelerateWP` back.
Both AccelerateWP and AccelerateWP Premium will be turned off.

![](./images/awp/AWPDisable.png)

This operation will:
* disable AccelerateWP tab in users' control panel interface
* disable all AccelerateWP optimization suites
* deactivate all optimization features for all users

This operation will NOT:
* cancel the subscription made by user in WHMCS or other billing. User's subscription stays 
  alive and user will still be charged in billing system unless hoster manually makes a refund


### Logs
The main AccelerateWP log is located at
* `/var/log/clwpos/main.log`


In case if AccelerateWP Premium is active, the auxiliary monitoring daemon `clwpos_monitoring` is also activated. Its log is located at
* `/var/log/clwpos/daemon.log`


### FAQ

#### With which panel can I use AccelerateWP?

Currently AccelerateWP is compatible with cPanel and Plesk only.

If you are interested in supporting DirectAdmin control panel, please record your demand on our feature portal respectively:
* [AccelerateWP for DirectAdmin](https://features.cloudlinux.com/c/15-acceleratewp-for-directadmin?utm_medium=social&utm_source=portal_share)


#### Is it possible to use AccelerateWP on a non-control panel server?

No, AccelerateWP is compatible with cPanel and Plesk only.

#### Do you plan to enable support of Nginx server?

This is a part of our very long term plans, thus not expected in the nearest future.

#### How will it help my customers?

AccelerateWP is a complex solution to help your customers increase their WordPress site performance. AccelerateWP brings number of optimization features, like object caching, css and js preprocessing and website preloading.

#### How could I monitor Redis instances while using AccelerateWP Premium suite?

Redis process is started for a user after activating AccelerateWP Premium Object Caching feature for at least one Wordpress site.
It is killed after AccelerateWP Premium Object Caching has been deactivated for all user's websites.

Look through the processes list to check Redis status for a particular user:
```
 $ ps aux | grep redis
 awpuser  2662517  0.0  0.5 101096  8512 ?        Sl   15:33   0:00 /opt/alt/redis/bin/redis-server unixsocket:/home/awpuser/.clwpos/redis.sock
```
In case if AccelerateWP Premium is active, the auxiliary monitoring daemon `clwpos_monitoring` is also activated. It checks Redis instances each 5 minutes, starts new instances, restart failed ones and kills the “garbage” instances if needed.
Check daemon status using `service clwpos_monitoring status` and its main log: `/var/log/clwpos/daemon.log`.

### My users are complaining that their feature are not installed automatically after subscription upgrade
This can be caused by several reasons. Either your customer's website was detected to have malfunctions
or there was an issue with environment when feature was installed 
(e.g. bad internet connectivity with wordpress market).

First, try to enable feature manually using AccelerateWP interface. 
Most likely you will find human-readable error message there.

Next, you can try to dive into `/var/log/clwpos/daemon.log` and find the reason why the `enable` command failed.
Here is an example of successful feature installation for reference:


    2023-02-14 11:01:14,696: (clwpos.daemon_base) [INFO] Running cloudlinux-awp-user enable --feature object_cache --domain wpujj.com --wp-path
    2023-02-14 11:01:15,081: (clwpos.daemon_base) [INFO] Command succeded with output:
    `CompletedProcess(args=['/bin/cagefs_enter.proxied', 'cloudlinux-awp-user', 'enable', '--feature', 'object_cache', '--domain', 'wpujj.com', '--wp-path', ''], returncode=0, stdout='{\n    "context": {\n        "domain": "wpujj.com",\n        "feature": "object_cache"\n    },\n    "result": "success",\n    "timestamp": 1676372475.044419,\n \n}\n', stderr='')`
    2023-02-14 11:01:15,086: (clwpos.daemon_base) [INFO] background process finished: pid=415368

Also, some useful notes may be present in user's log located at `/home/<username>/.clwpos/main.log`.

If the issue persists, or you cannot resolve it yourself, 
contact CloudLinux support and attach `/var/log/clwpos/daemon.log` and `/home/<username>/.clwpos/main.log` 
for further investigation.


### Troubleshooting

#### End-users of AccelerateWP Premium feature encounter Redis extension is not installed for selected php version
In order to make use of AccelerateWP Premium Object Caching feature, the loaded Redis extension is required for the end-user's website.
End-users will not be able to activate the Object Caching feature until Redis extension configuration is incomplete.

Corresponding incompatibility warning will be displayed in control panel's User interface:

![](./images/awp/AWPNoRedis.png)

The Redis extensions are configured for all installed and supported PHP versions automatically:
* right after the AccelerateWP Premium suite is enabled
* by cron once a day

or you can trigger the utility manually:
```
/usr/sbin/enable_redis_for_panel_php
```

All errors will be displayed in standard output and logged into `/var/log/clwpos/main.log`.


**Ensuring the EA-PHP Redis extension is configured correctly**

1. Check Redis extension package is installed by running the following command

    ```
    rpm -q ea-phpXY-php-redis
    ```
    Install the corresponding extension if it is not present:
    ```
    yum install ea-phpXY-php-redis
    ```
    Consider the example for checking out and installing Redis extension for `ea-php74`: 
    ```
    rpm -q ea-php74-php-redis
    yum install ea-php74-php-redis
    ```
2. Check Redis `ini` file is present by running the following command:
    ```
    ls /opt/cpanel/ea-phpXY/root/etc/php.d/ | grep 50-redis
    ```
    Consider the example for checking out Redis extension for `ea-php74`: 
    ```
    ls /opt/cpanel/ea-php74/root/etc/php.d/ | grep 50-redis
    ```
    Try reinstalling the package if `ini` file is missing.
3. Make sure Redis module is loaded under specific user by running the following command:
    ```
    su -c "php -m | grep redis" <username>
    ```


**Ensuring the ALT-PHP Redis extension is configured correctly**

1. Check if `redis.so` is present for a particular alt-php version:
    ```
    ls /opt/alt/phpXY/usr/lib64/php/modules | grep redis.so
    ```
    Consider the example for checking alt-php74 redis.so:
    ```
    ls /opt/alt/php74/usr/lib64/php/modules | grep redis.so
    redis.so
    ```
2. If the Redis module is missing:
   
   a. Install the `alt-phpXY-pecl-ext` package manually
   b. Run the Redis configuration script `/usr/share/cloudlinux/wpos/enable_redis_for_alt_php.py`
      
   All errors will be displayed in standard output and logged into `/var/log/clwpos/main.log`.
3. If the Redis module is present for a particular php version, but the incompatibility issue persists, re-check the following:
    
    a. Make sure the Redis module is loaded under user:
    ```
    su -c "php -m | grep redis" <username>
    ```
    b. Check the required extensions are enabled in `php.ini`:
    ```
    cat /opt/alt/phpXY/etc/php.ini | grep redis.so
    cat /opt/alt/phpXY/etc/php.ini | grep json.so
    cat /opt/alt/phpXY/etc/php.ini | grep igbinary.so
    ```
    
    c. Enable missing extensions manually.


#### End-users of AccelerateWP encounter PHP-related issues during feature activation
End-users may encounter PHP-related errors while activating the AccelerateWP features.

![](./images/awp/AWPBrokenPHP.png)

The general examples of possible reasons are:
* broken PHP binaries
* missing PHP files
* etc.

To check that this issue is caused by PHP itself, call any PHP command, for example:
```
/opt/cpanel/ea-php80/root/usr/bin/php -i
```
And make sure that installed `ea-php80` packages are not broken using
`rpm -V <package_name>`.

Reinstall broken packages if found.

Consider the example issue (presented at the picture above) with broken `mbstring.so` for `ea-php80`:
```
# /opt/cpanel/ea-php80/root/usr/bin/php -i
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
# rpm -V ea-php80
# rpm -V ea-php80-php-mbstring
S.5....T.    /opt/cpanel/ea-php80/root/usr/lib64/php/modules/mbstring.so
......G..  a /usr/lib/.build-id/9c/38ed78a6d401ff6dce059ccea51c95870d98c5
# yum reinstall ea-php80-php-mbstring
```
