While adding credit card details, you can also choose **Auto add funds** option - the funds amount you choose in pull down menu will be automatically added when your balance is below $100.

If you choose **Auto repay** , your card will be automatically charged when your balance becomes negative. Minimal charge is $20 ( _E.g. for balance -$15 - you'll be charged at $20, for balance -$134.2 - you'll be charged at $134.2_ ).
